<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>

</div>

<p><i>The English Language hath
been much cultivated during
the last two hundred
years. It hath been considerably
polished and refined; it hath been
greatly enlarged in extent and compass;
its force and energy, its variety,
richness, and elegance, have
been tried with good success, in
verse and in prose, upon all subjects,
and in every kind of stile:
but whatever other improvements
it may have received, it hath made
no advances in Grammatical accuracy.</i></p>

<p><i>It is now about fifty years
since Doctor <span class="antiqua">Swift</span> made a public
remonstrance, addressed to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_ii"></a>[ii]</span>
Earl of <span class="antiqua">Oxford</span>, then Lord Treasurer,
of the imperfect State of
our Language; alledging in particular,
“that in many instances it
offended against every part of
Grammar.” <span class="antiqua">Swift</span> must be allowed
to have been a good judge of
this matter. He was himself very
attentive to this part, both in his
own writings, and in his remarks
upon those of his friends: he is one
of our most correct, and perhaps
our very best prose writer. Indeed
the justness of this complaint,
as far as I can find, hath never
been questioned; and yet no effectual
method hath hitherto been taken
to redress the grievance of which he
complains.</i></p>

<p><i>But let us consider, how, and in
what extent, we are to understand
this charge brought against the
<span class="antiqua">English</span> Language. Does it mean,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_iii"></a>[iii]</span>
that the <span class="antiqua">English</span> Language as it is
spoken by the politest part of the
nation, and as it stands in the
writings of our most approved authors,
oftentimes offends against
every part of Grammar? Thus
far, I am afraid, the charge is
true. Or does it further imply,
that our Language is in its nature
irregular and capricious; not subject,
or not easily reduceable, to a
System of rules? In this respect,
I am persuaded, the charge is
wholly without foundation.</i></p>

<p><i>The <span class="antiqua">English</span> Language is perhaps
of all the present European
Languages by much the most simple
in its form and construction. Of
all the ancient Languages extant
that is the most simple, which is undoubtedly
the most ancient: but
even that Language itself does not
equal the <span class="antiqua">English</span> in simplicity.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_iv"></a>[iv]</span></p>

<p><i>The Words of the <span class="antiqua">English</span> Language
are subject to fewer variations
from their original Form,
than those perhaps of any other
Language whatsoever. Its Substantives
have but one variation of
Case: nor have they any beside
the natural distinction of Gender.
Its Adjectives admit of no change
at all, except that which expresses
the degrees of Comparison. All the
possible variations of the original
form of the Verb are not above six
or seven; whereas in many Languages
they amount to one or two
hundred: and almost the whole business
of Modes, Times, and Voices
is managed with great ease by the
assistance of eight or nine commodious
little Verbs; called from their
use Auxiliaries. The Construction
of this Language is so easy and
obvious, that our Grammarians<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_v"></a>[v]</span>
have thought it hardly worth while
to give us any thing like a regular
and systematical Syntax. The last
<span class="antiqua">English</span> Grammar that hath been
presented to the public, and by the
Person best qualified to have given
us a perfect one, comprises the whole
Syntax in ten lines. The reason,
which he assigns for being so very
concise in this part, is, “because
our Language has so little inflection,
that its Construction
neither requires nor admits many
rules.” In truth, the easier
any subject is in its own nature, the
harder is it to make it more easy by
explanation; and nothing is commonly
more unnecessary, and at the
same time more difficult, than to
give a Demonstration in form of a
proposition almost self-evident.</i></p>

<p><i>It is not owing then to any peculiar
irregularity or difficulty of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi"></a>[vi]</span>
our Language, that the general
practice both of speaking and
writing it is chargeable with inaccuracy.
It is not the Language,
but the practice, that is in
fault. The truth is, Grammar is
very much neglected among us:
and it is not the difficulty of the
Language, but on the contrary the
simplicity and facility of it, that
occasions this neglect. Were the
Language less easy and simple, we
should find ourselves under a necessity
of studying it with more care and
attention. But as it is, we take it
for granted, that we have a competent
knowledge and skill, and are
able to acquit ourselves properly, in
our own native tongue: a faculty
solely acquired by use, conducted by
habit, and tried by the ear, carries
us on without reflection; we meet
with no rubs or difficulties in our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vii"></a>[vii]</span>
way, or we do not perceive them;
we find ourselves able to go on without
rules, and we do not so much as
suspect that we stand in need of
them.</i></p>

<p><i>A Grammatical Study of our
own Language makes no part of the
ordinary method of instruction which
we pass thro’ in our childhood; and
it is very seldom that we apply
ourselves to it afterward. And yet
the want of it will not be effectually
supplied by any other advantages
whatsoever. Much practice in
the polite world, and a general acquaintance
with the best authors,
are good helps, but alone will hardly
be sufficient: we have writers,
who have enjoyed these advantages
in their full extent, and yet cannot
be recommended as models of an accurate
style. Much less then will
what is commonly called Learning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii"></a>[viii]</span>
serve the purpose; that is, a critical
knowledge of ancient languages,
and much reading of ancient authors:
the greatest Critic and most
able Grammarian of the last age,
when he came to apply his Learning
and his Criticism to an English Author,
was frequently at a loss in
matters of ordinary use and common
construction in his own <span class="antiqua">Vernacular
Idiom</span>.</i></p>

<p><i>But perhaps the Notes subjoined
to the following pages will furnish
a more convincing argument, than
any thing that can be said here, both
of the truth of the charge of inaccuracy
brought against our Language
as it subsists in practice, and
of the necessity of investigating the
Principles of it, and studying it
Grammatically, if we would attain
to a due degree of skill in it. It is
with reason expected of every person<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_ix"></a>[ix]</span>
of a liberal education, and much
more is it indispensably required of
every one who undertakes to inform
or entertain the public, that he should
be able to express himself with propriety
and accuracy. It will evidently
appear from these Notes, that
our best Authors for want of some
rudiments of this kind have sometimes
fallen into mistakes, and been guilty
of palpable errors in point of Grammar.
The examples there given are
such as occurred in reading, without
any very curious or methodical examination:
and they might easily
have been much increased in number
by any one, who had leisure or phlegm
enough to have gone through a regular
course of reading with this
particular view. However, I believe,
they may be sufficient to answer
the purpose intended; to evince
the necessity of the Study of Grammar<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_x"></a>[x]</span>
in our own Language, and to
admonish those, who set up for Authors
among us, that they would do
well to consider this part of Learning
as an object not altogether beneath
their regard.</i></p>

<p><i>The principal design of a Grammar
of any Language is to teach us
to express ourselves with propriety in
that Language, and to be able to
judge of every phrase and form of
construction, whether it be right or
not. The plain way of doing this,
is to lay down rules, and to illustrate
them by examples. But besides
shewing what is right, the
matter may be further explained by
pointing out what is wrong. I will
not take upon me to say, whether we
have any Grammar that sufficiently
performs the first part: but the latter
method here called in, as subservient
to the former, may perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xi"></a>[xi]</span>
be found in this case to be of the
two the more useful and effectual
manner of instruction.</i></p>

<p><i>Besides this principal design of
Grammar in our own Language,
there is a secondary use to which it
may be applied, and which, I think,
is not attended to as it deserves. A
good foundation in the General
Principles of Grammar is in the
first place necessary for all those who
are initiated in a learned education;
and for all others likewise,
who shall have occasion to furnish
themselves with the knowledge of modern,
languages. Universal Grammar
cannot be taught abstractedly:
it must be done with reference to
some language already known, in
which the terms are to be explained,
and the rules exemplified. The
learner is supposed to be unacquainted
with all but his own native<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xii"></a>[xii]</span>
tongue; and in what other, consistently
with reason and common sense,
would you go about to explain it to
him? When he has a competent
knowledge of the main principles,
the common terms, the general rules,
the whole subject and business of
Grammar, exemplified in his own
Language; he then will apply himself
with great advantage to any
foreign language, whether ancient
or modern. To enter at once upon
the Science of Grammar, and the
Study of a foreign Language, is to
encounter two difficulties together,
each of which would be much lessened
by being taken separately and
in its proper order. For these plain
reasons a competent Grammatical
knowledge of our own Language is
the true foundation upon which all
Literature, properly so called, ought
to be raised. If this method were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiii"></a>[xiii]</span>
adopted in our Schools; if children
were first taught the common principles
of Grammar by some short and
clear System of <span class="antiqua">English</span> Grammar,
which happily by its simplicity and
facility is perhaps of all others the
fittest for such a purpose, they would
have some notion of what they were
going about, when they should enter
into the <span class="antiqua">Latin</span> Grammar; and
would hardly be engaged so many
years, as they now are, in that
most irksome and difficult part of
literature, with so much labour of
the memory, and with so little assistance
of the understanding.</i></p>

<p><i>A design somewhat of this kind
gave occasion to the following little
System, intended merely for a private
and domestic use. The chief end of it
was to explain the general principles
of Grammar as clearly and
intelligibly as possible. In the Definitions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiv"></a>[xiv]</span>
therefore easiness and perspicuity
have been sometimes prefered
to logical exactness. The common
Divisions have been complied with, as
far as truth and reason would permit.
The known and received Terms
have been retained, except in one or
two instances, where others offered
themselves, which seemed much more
significant. All disquisitions, which
appeared to have more of subtilty
than of usefulness in them, have been
avoided. In a word, it was calculated
for the use of the Learner
even of the lowest class. Those, who
would enter more deeply into this
Subject, will find it fully and accurately
handled, with the greatest
acuteness of investigation, perspicuity
of explication, and elegance
of method, in a Treatise intitled
<span class="smcap">Hermes</span>, by <span class="smcap">James Harris</span> Esq;
the most beautiful and perfect<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xv"></a>[xv]</span>
example of Analysis that has been
exhibited since the days of <span class="antiqua">Aristotle</span>.</i></p>

<p><i>The following short System is
proposed only as an Essay, upon
a Subject, tho’ of little esteem,
yet of no small importance; and
in which the want of something
better adapted to real use and
practice, than what we have at
present, seems to be generally acknowledged.
If those, who are
qualified to judge of such matters,
and do not look upon them as
beneath their notice, shall so far
approve of it, as to think it
worth a revisal, and capable of
being improved into something
really useful; their remarks and
assistance, communicated through
the hands of the Bookseller, shall
be received with all proper deference
and acknowledgement.</i></p>

<h1>A SHORT<br>
INTRODUCTION<br>
TO<br>
ENGLISH GRAMMAR.</h1>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="GRAMMAR">GRAMMAR.</h2>

</div>

<p>Grammar is the Art of rightly
expressing our thoughts by
Words.</p>

<p>Grammar in general, or Universal
Grammar, explains the Principles
which are common to all languages.</p>

<p>The Grammar of any particular
Language, as the English Grammar,
applies those common principles
to that particular language, according
to the established usage and
custom of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span></p>

<p>Grammar treats of Sentences, and
the several parts of which they are
compounded.</p>

<p>Sentences consist of Words; Words,
of one or more Syllables; Syllables,
of one or more Letters.</p>

<p>So that Letters, Syllables, Words,
and Sentences, make up the whole
subject of Grammar.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="LETTERS">LETTERS.</h2>

</div>

<p>A Letter is the first Principle, or
least part of a Word.</p>

<p>An Articulate Sound is the sound
of the human voice, formed by the
organs of speech.</p>

<p>A Vowel is a simple articulate
sound, formed by the impulse of the
voice, and by the opening only of
the mouth in a particular manner.</p>

<p>A Consonant cannot be perfectly
sounded by itself; but joined with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
a vowel forms a compound articulate
sound, by a particular motion
or contact of the parts of the mouth.</p>

<p>A Diphthong, or Double Vowel,
is the union of two or more vowels
pronounced by a single impulse of
the voice.</p>

<p>In English there are twenty-six
Letters:</p>

<p>A, a; B, b; C, c; D, d; E, e;
F, f; G, g; H, h; I, i; J, j; K, k;
L, l; M, m; N, n; O, o; P, p;
Q, q; R, r; S, s; T, t; U, u;
V, v; W, w; X, x; Y, y; Z, z.</p>

<p><i>J j</i>, and <i>V v</i>, are consonants;
the former having the sound of the
soft <i>g</i>, and the latter that of a coarser
<i>f</i>: they are therefore intirely different
from the vowels <i>i</i> and <i>u</i>, and
distinct letters of themselves; they
ought also to be distinguished by a
peculiar Name; the former may be
called <i>ja</i>, and the latter <i>vee</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span></p>

<p>Six of the letters are vowels, and
may be sounded by themselves; <i>a</i>,
<i>e</i>, <i>i</i>, <i>o</i>, <i>u</i>, <i>y</i>.</p>

<p><i>Y</i> is in sound wholly the same
with i; and is written instead of it
at the end of words; or before another
<i>i</i>, as <i>flying</i>, <i>denying</i>: it is retained
likewise in some words derived
from the Greek; and it is always
a vowel.</p>

<p><i>W</i> is either a vowel, or a diphthong:
its proper sound is the same
as the Italian <i>u</i>, the French <i>ou</i>, or
the English <i>oo</i>: after <i>o</i>, it is sometimes
not sounded at all, sometimes
like a single <i>u</i>.</p>

<p>The rest of the letters are consonants;
which cannot be sounded
alone: some not at all, and these
are called Mutes, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>g</i>, <i>k</i>, <i>p</i>, <i>q</i>,
<i>t</i>: others very imperfectly, making
a kind of obscure sound, and these
are called Semi-vowels, or Half-vowels,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
<i>l</i>, <i>m</i>, <i>n</i>, <i>r</i>, <i>f</i>, <i>s</i>; the first
four of which are also distinguished
by the name of Liquids.</p>

<p>The Mutes and the Semi-vowels
are distinguished by their names in
the Alphabet, those of the former
all beginning with a consonant; <i>bee</i>,
<i>cee</i>, &amp;c; those of the latter all beginning
with a vowel, <i>ef</i>, <i>el</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>X</i> is a double consonant, compounded
of <i>c</i>, or <i>k</i>, and <i>s</i>.</p>

<p><i>Z</i> seems not to be a double consonant
in English, as it is commonly
supposed: it has the same relation
to <i>s</i>, as <i>v</i> has to <i>f</i>, being a
thicker and coarser expression of it.</p>

<p><i>H</i> is only an Aspiration, or Breathing:
and sometimes at the beginning
of a word is not sounded at
all; as, <i>an hour</i>, <i>an honest</i> man.</p>

<p><i>C</i> is pronounced like <i>k</i>, before <i>a</i>,
<i>o</i>, <i>u</i>; and soft, like <i>s</i>, before <i>e</i>, <i>i</i>, <i>y</i>:
in like manner <i>g</i> is pronounced always<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
hard before <i>a</i>, <i>o</i>, <i>u</i>; sometimes
hard and sometimes soft before <i>i</i>,
and <i>y</i>; and for the most part soft
before <i>e</i>.</p>

<p>The English Alphabet, like most
others, is both deficient and redundant;
in some cases, the same letters
expressing different sounds, and

</div>

<p>A Syllable is a sound either simple
or compounded, pronounced
by a single impulse of the voice,
and constituting a word, or part of
a word.</p>

<p>Spelling is the art of reading by
naming the letters singly, and rightly
dividing words into their syllables.
Or, in writing, it is the expressing
of a word by its proper letters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span></p>

<p>In Spelling, a syllable in the beginning
or middle of a word ends
in a vowel, unless the consonant <i>x</i>
follow it, or two consonants, whereof
the former is a liquid, or the
same as the latter.</p>

<p>But the best and only sure rule
for dividing the syllables in spelling,
is to divide them as they are naturally
divided in a right pronunciation.</p>

<p>Words are articulate sounds,
used by common consent as
signs of ideas, or notions.</p>

<p>There are in English nine Sorts of
Words, or, as they are commonly
called, Parts of Speech.</p>

<p>1. The <span class="smcap">Article</span>, prefixed to
substantives, when they are common
names of things, to point them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
out, and to shew how far their signification
extends.</p>

<p>2. The <span class="smcap">Substantive</span>, or <span class="smcap">Noun</span>,
being the name of any thing conceived
to subsist, or of which we
have any notion.</p>

<p>3. The <span class="smcap">Pronoun</span>, standing instead
of the noun.</p>

<p>4. The <span class="smcap">Adjective</span>, added to the
noun to express the quality of it.</p>

<p>5. The <span class="smcap">Verb</span>, or Word by way
of eminence, signifying to be, to do,
or to suffer.</p>

<p>6. The <span class="smcap">Adverb</span>, added to verbs,
and also to adjectives and other
adverbs, to express some circumstance
belonging to them.</p>

<p>7. The <span class="smcap">Preposition</span>, put before
nouns and pronouns chiefly, to
connect them with other words, and
to shew their relation to them.</p>

<p>8. The <span class="smcap">Conjunction</span>, connecting
sentences together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span></p>

<p>9. The <span class="smcap">Interjection</span>, thrown
in to express the affection of the
speaker, though unnecessary with
respect to the construction of the
sentence.</p>

<p>In the foregoing sentence the
Words <i>the</i>, <i>a</i>, are Articles; <i>power</i>,
<i>speech</i>, <i>faculty</i>, <i>man</i>, <i>creator</i>, <i>uses</i>,
<i>purposes</i>, are Substantives; <i>him</i>, <i>his</i>,
<i>we</i>, <i>it</i>, are Pronouns; <i>peculiar</i>, <i>beneficent</i>,
<i>greatest</i>, <i>excellent</i>, <i>worst</i>,
are Adjectives; <i>is</i>, <i>was</i>, <i>bestowed</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
<i>do</i>, <i>pervert</i>, are Verbs; <i>most</i>, <i>how</i>,
<i>often</i>, are Adverbs; <i>of</i>, <i>to</i>, <i>on</i>, <i>by</i>,
<i>for</i>, are Prepositions; <i>and</i>, <i>but</i>, are
Conjunctions; and <i>alas</i> is an Interjection.</p>

<p>The Substantives <i>power</i>, <i>speech</i>,
<i>faculty</i>, and the rest, are General,
or Common, Names of things;
whereof there are many sorts belonging
to the same kind, or many
individuals belonging to the same
sort: as there are many sorts of
power, many sorts of speech, many
sorts of faculty, many individuals of
that sort of animal called man; and
so on. These general or common
names are here applied in a more
or less extensive signification, according
as they are used without
either, or with the one, or with the
other, of the two Articles <i>a</i> and <i>the</i>.
The words <i>speech</i>, <i>man</i>, being accompanied
with no article, are taken<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
in their largest extent, and signify
all of the kind or sort, all sorts of
speech, and all men. The word
<i>faculty</i>, with the article <i>a</i> before
it, is used in a more confined signification,
for some one out of many
of that kind; for it is here implied,
that there are other faculties peculiar
to man beside speech. The
words <i>power</i>, <i>creator</i>, <i>uses</i>, <i>purposes</i>,
with the article <i>the</i> before them,
(for <i>his</i> Creator is the same as <i>the</i>
Creator <i>of him</i>) are used in the most
confined signification for the things
here mentioned and ascertained:
<i>the power</i> is not any one indeterminate
power out of many sorts, but
that particular sort of power here
specified, namely, the power of
speech; <i>the creator</i> is the One great
Creator of man and of all things;
<i>the uses</i>, and <i>the purposes</i>, are particular
uses and purposes; the former<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
are explained to be those in
particular, that are the greatest and
most excellent; such for instance,
as the glory of God, and the common
benefit of mankind; the latter,
to be the worst, as lying,
slandering, blaspheming, and the
like.</p>

<p>The Pronouns <i>him</i>, <i>his</i>, <i>we</i>, <i>it</i>,
stand instead of some of the nouns,
or substantives, going before them;
as <i>him</i> supplies the place of <i>man</i>;
<i>his</i> of <i>man’s</i>; <i>we</i> of <i>men</i> (implied in
the general name <i>man</i>, including all
men, of which number is the speaker;)
<i>it</i> of <i>the power</i>, before mentioned.
If instead of these pronouns
the nouns for which they stand
had been used, the sense would have
been the same, but the frequent repetition
of the same words would
have been disagreeable and tedious:
as, The power of speech peculiar to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
<i>man</i>, bestowed on <i>man</i>, by <i>man’s</i>
Creator, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The Adjectives <i>peculiar</i>, <i>beneficent</i>,
<i>greatest</i>, <i>excellent</i>, <i>worst</i>, are
added to their several substantives
to denote the character and quality
of each.</p>

<p>The Verbs <i>is</i>, <i>was bestowed</i>, <i>do
pervert</i>, signify severally, being, suffering,
and doing. By the first it
is implied, that there is such a thing
as the power of speech, and it is affirmed
to be of such a kind; namely,
a faculty peculiar to man: by
the second it is said to have been
acted upon, or to have suffered, or
to have had something done to it;
namely, to have been bestowed on
man: by the last, we are said to act
upon it, or to do something to it;
namely, to pervert it.</p>

<p>The Adverbs <i>most</i>, <i>often</i>, are added
to the adjective <i>excellent</i>, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
to the verb <i>pervert</i>, to shew the
circumstance belonging to them;
namely, that of the highest degree
to the former, and that of frequency
to the latter: concerning the degree
of which frequency also a question
is made by the adverb <i>how</i>,
added to the adverb <i>often</i>.</p>

<p>The Prepositions <i>of</i>, <i>to</i>, <i>on</i>, <i>by</i>,
<i>for</i>, placed before the substantives
and pronouns <i>speech</i>, <i>man</i>, <i>him</i>, &amp;<i>c.</i>
connect them with other words,
substantives, adjectives, and verbs,
as <i>power</i>, <i>peculiar</i>, <i>bestowed</i>, &amp;<i>c.</i>
and shew the relation which they
have to those words; as the relation
of subject, object, agent, end;
<i>for</i> denoting the end, <i>by</i> the agent,
<i>on</i>, the object; <i>to</i> and <i>of</i> denote
possession, or the belonging of one
thing to another.</p>

<p>The Conjunctions <i>and</i>, and <i>but</i>,
connect the three parts of the sentence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
together; the first more closely
both with regard to the sentence
and the sense; the second connecting
the parts of the sentence, tho’
less strictly, and at the same time
expressing an opposition in the
sense.</p>

<p>The Interjection <i>alas!</i> expresses
the concern and regret of the speaker;
and though thrown in with
propriety, yet might have been omitted
without injuring the construction
of the sentence, or destroying
the sense.</p>

<h3>ARTICLE.</h3>

<p>The Article is a word prefixed
to substantives, to point them
out, and to shew how far their signification
extends.</p>

<p>In English there are but two articles,
<i>a</i>, and <i>the</i>: <i>a</i> becomes <i>an</i>
before a vowel or a silent <i>h</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span></p>

<p><i>A</i> is used in a vague sense to
point out one single thing of the
kind, in other respects indeterminate:
<i>the</i> determines what particular
thing is meant.</p>

<p>A substantive without any article
to limit it is taken in its widest
sense: thus <i>man</i> means all mankind;
as,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The proper study of mankind is man:”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right"><span class="smcap">Pope.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>where <i>mankind</i> and <i>man</i> may change
places without making any alteration
in the sense. <i>A man</i> means
some one or other of that kind, indefinitely;
<i>the man</i> means, definitely,
that particular man, who is
spoken of: the former therefore is
called the Indefinite, the latter the
Definite, Article<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span></p>

<p>Example: “<i>Man</i> was made for
society, and ought to extend his
good-will to all <i>men</i>: but <i>a man</i>
will naturally entertain a more particular<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
kindness for <i>the men</i> with
whom he has the most frequent
intercourse; and enter into a still
closer union with <i>the man</i>, whose<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
temper and disposition suit best with
his own.”</p>

<p>It is of the nature of both the
Articles to determine or limit the
thing spoken of: <i>a</i> determines it
to be one single thing of the kind,
leaving it still uncertain which; <i>the</i>
determines which it is, or of many
which they are. The first therefore
can only be joined to Substantives
in the singular number<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>; the
last may also be joined to plurals.</p>

<p>There is a remarkable exception
to this rule in the use of the Adjectives
<i>few</i> and <i>many</i>, (the latter chiefly
with the word <i>great</i> before it)
which, though joined with plural
Substantives, yet admit of the
singular Article <i>a</i>: as, <i>a few men</i>,
<i>a great many men</i>;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Told of <i>a many thousand</i> warlike French:”—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“The care-craz’d mother of <i>a many children</i>.”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right"><span class="smcap">Shakespear.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The reason of it is manifest from
the effect which the Article has in
these phrases: it means a small or
great number collectively taken,
and therefore gives the idea of a
Whole, that is, of Unity. Thus
likewise <i>a hundred</i>, <i>a thousand</i>, is
one whole number, an aggregate of
many collectively taken; and therefore
still retains the Article <i>a</i>, tho’
joined as an Adjective to a plural
Substantive: as, <i>a hundred years</i>;<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“For harbour at <i>a thousand doors</i> they knock’d;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Not one of all <i>the thousand</i>, but was lock’d.”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right"><span class="smcap">Dryden.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Definite Article <i>the</i> is sometimes
applied to Adverbs in the
comparative degree, and its effect is
to mark the degree the more strongly,
and to define it the more precisely:
as, “<i>The more</i> I examine it, <i>the better</i>
I like it. I like this <i>the least</i> of
any.”</p>

<h3>SUBSTANTIVE.</h3>

<p>A Substantive, or Noun, is the
Name of a thing; of whatever
we conceive in any way to subsist,
or of which we have any notion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span></p>

<p>Substantives are of two sorts;
Proper, and Common, Names. Proper
Names are the names appropriated
to individuals; as the names of
persons and places: such are <i>George</i>,
<i>London</i>. Common Names stand for
kinds, containing many sorts; or
sorts, containing many individuals
under them; as, <i>Animal</i>, <i>Man</i>.</p>

<p>Proper Names being the names of
individuals, and therefore of things
already as determinate as they can
be made, admit not of Articles, or
of Plurality of Number; unless by
a Figure, or by Accident: as when
great Conquerors are called <i>Alexanders</i>;
and some great Conqueror
<i>An</i> Alexander, or <i>The</i> Alexander
of his age; when a Common Name
is understood, as <i>The</i> Thames, that
is, the <i>River</i> Thames; <i>The</i> George,
that is, the <i>Sign</i> of St. George: or
when it happens that there are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
many persons of the same name;
as, <i>The</i> two <i>Scipios</i>.</p>

<p>Whatever is spoken of is represented
as one, or more, in Number:
these two manners of representation
in respect of number are called the
Singular, and the Plural, Number.</p>

<p>In English, the Substantive Singular
is made Plural, for the most
part, by adding to it <i>s</i>; or <i>es</i>, where
it is necessary for the pronunciation:
as, <i>king</i>, <i>kings</i>; <i>fox</i>, <i>foxes</i>;
<i>leaf</i>, <i>leaves</i>; in which last, and
many others, <i>f</i> is also changed into
<i>v</i>, for the sake of an easier pronunciation,
and more agreeable sound.
Some few Plurals end in <i>en</i>: as,
<i>oxen</i>, <i>chicken</i>, <i>children</i>, <i>brethren</i>;
and <i>men</i>, <i>women</i>, by changing the
<i>a</i> of the Singular into <i>e</i><a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>. This<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
form we have retained from the
Teutonic; as likewise the introduction
of the <i>e</i> in the former syllable
of two of the last instances;
<i>weomen</i>, (for so we pronounce it)
<i>brethren</i>, from <i>woman</i>, <i>brother</i><a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>:
something like which may be noted
in some other forms of Plurals; as,
<i>mouse</i>, <i>mice</i>; <i>louse</i>, <i>lice</i>; <i>tooth</i>, <i>teeth</i>;
<i>foot</i>, <i>feet</i>; <i>goose</i>, <i>geese</i><a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>.</p>

<p>The English Language, to express
different connexions and relations
of one thing to another, uses,
for the most part, Prepositions. The
Greek and Latin among the antient,
and some too among the modern<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
languages, as the German, vary
the termination or ending of the
Substantive to answer the same purpose.
These different endings are
in those languages called Cases.
And the English being derived from
the same origin as the German,
that is, from the Teutonic<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>, is not
wholly without them. For instance,
the relation of Possession, or Belonging,
is often expressed by a
Case, or a different ending of the
Substantive. This Case answers to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
the Genitive Case in Latin, and
may still be so called; tho’ perhaps
more properly the Possessive Case.
Thus, “<i>God’s</i> grace:” which may
also be expressed by the Preposition;
as, “the grace <i>of God</i>.” It
was formerly written <i>Godis</i> grace;
we now very improperly always
shorten it with an Apostrophe, even
tho’ we are obliged to pronounce it
fully; as, “<i>Thomas’s</i> book:” that
is, “<i>Thomasis</i> book;” not “<i>Thomas
his</i> book,” as it is commonly
supposed<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span></p>

<p>When the thing, to which another
is said to belong, is expressed
by a circumlocution, or by many
terms, the sign of the Possessive
Case is added to the last term: as,
“The King of Great <i>Britain’s</i> Soldiers.”
When it is a Noun ending
with <i>s</i>, or in the Plural Number in
<i>s</i>, the sign of the Possessive Case is
not added: as, “for <i>righteousness</i>
sake; on <i>eagles</i> wings.” Both the
Sign and the Preposition seem
sometimes to be used: as, “a soldier
<i>of the king’s</i>:” but here
are really two Possessives; for it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
means, “one <i>of</i> the soldiers <i>of</i> the
king.”</p>

<p>The English in its Substantives
has but two different terminations
for Cases; that of the Nominative,
which simply expresses the Name of
the thing, and that of the Possessive
Case.</p>

<p>Things are frequently considered
with relation to the distinction of
Sex or Gender; as being Male, or
Female, or Neither the one, nor the
other. Hence Substantives are of
the Masculine, or Feminine, or Neuter,
that is, Neither, Gender: which
latter is only the exclusion of all consideration
of Gender.</p>

<p>The English Language, with singular
propriety, following nature alone,
applies the distinction of Masculine
and Feminine only to the
names of Animals; all the rest are
Neuter: except when by a Poetical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
or Rhetorical fiction things inanimate
and Qualities are exhibited as Persons,
and consequently become either Male
or Female. And this gives the English
an advantage above most other
languages in the Poetical and Rhetorical
Style: for when Nouns naturally
Neuter are converted into Masculine
and Feminine<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>, the Personification<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
is more distinctly and forcibly
marked.</p>

<p>Some few Substantives are distinguished
as to their Gender by their
termination: as, <i>prince</i>, <i>princess</i>;
<i>actor</i>, <i>actress</i>; <i>lion</i>, <i>lioness</i>; <i>hero</i>,
<i>heroine</i>; &amp;c.</p>

<p>The chief use of Gender in English
is in the Pronoun of the Third
Person, which must agree in that
respect with the Noun for which it
stands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span></p>

<h3>PRONOUN.</h3>

<p>A Pronoun is a word standing instead
of a Noun, as its Substitute
or Representative.</p>

<p>In the Pronoun are to be considered
the Person, Number, Gender
and Case.</p>

<p>There are Three Persons which
may be the Subject of any discourse:
first, the Person who speaks may
speak of himself; secondly, he may
speak of the Person to whom he
addresses himself; thirdly, he may
speak of some other Person.</p>

<p>These are called, respectively, the
First, Second, and Third, Persons:
and are expressed by the Pronouns
<i>I</i>, <i>Thou</i>, <i>He</i>.</p>

<p>As the Speakers, the Persons
spoken to, and the Persons spoken
of, may be many, so each of these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
Persons hath the Plural Number;
<i>We</i>, <i>Ye</i>, <i>They</i>.</p>

<p>The Persons speaking and spoken
to are supposed to be present, from
which and other circumstances their
Sex is commonly known, and needs
not to be marked by a distinction of
Gender in their Pronouns: but the
Person spoken of being absent and in
many respects unknown, it is necessary
that it should be marked by a
distinction of Gender; at least when
some particular Person is spoken of,
who ought to be more distinctly
marked: accordingly the Pronoun
Singular of the Third Person hath
the Three Genders, <i>He</i>, <i>She</i>, <i>It</i>.</p>

<p>Pronouns have Three Cases; the
Nominative; the Genitive, or Possessive;
like Nouns; and moreover
a Case, which follows the Verb
Active, or the Preposition, expressing
the Object of an Action, or of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
a Relation. It answers to the Oblique
Cases in Latin; and may be
properly enough called the Objective
Case.</p>

<p>The Personal Pronouns have the
nature of Substantives, and as such
stand by themselves: the rest have
the nature of Adjectives, and as
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>such are joined to Substantives;
and may be called Pronominal Adjectives.</p>

<p><i>Thy</i>, <i>My</i>, <i>Her</i>, <i>Our</i>, <i>Your</i>, <i>Their</i>,
are Pronominal Adjectives: but
<i>His</i>, (that is, <i>Hee’s</i>) <i>Her’s</i>, <i>Our’s</i>,
<i>Your’s</i>, <i>Their’s</i>, have evidently the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
Form of the Possessive Case: and
by Analogy, <i>Mine</i>, <i>Thine</i><a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>, may be
esteemed of the same rank. All
these are used, when the Noun they
belong to is understood: the two
latter sometimes also instead of <i>my</i>,
<i>thy</i>, when the Noun following them
begins with a vowel.</p>

<p>Beside the foregoing there are
several other Pronominal Adjectives;
which tho’ they may sometimes
seem to stand by themselves,
yet have always some Substantive
belonging to them, either referred<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
to, or understood: as, <i>This</i>, <i>that</i>,
<i>other</i>, <i>any</i>, <i>some</i>, <i>one</i>, <i>none</i>; these
are called Definitive, because they
define and limit the extent of the
thing, to which they either refer,
or are joined. The three first of
these are varied to express Number;
as, <i>These</i>, <i>those</i>, <i>others</i>; the last of
which admits of the Plural form
only when its Substantive is not
joined to it, but referred to, or understood:
none of them are varied
to express the Gender or Case. <i>One</i>
is sometimes used in an Indefinite
sense (answering to the French <i>on</i>)
as in the following phrases; “<i>one</i>
is apt to think;” “<i>one</i> sees;” “<i>one</i>
supposes.” <i>Who</i>, <i>which</i>, <i>that</i>, are
called Relatives, because they more
directly refer to some Substantive
going before; which therefore is
called the Antecedent. They also
connect the following part of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
Sentence with the foregoing. These
belong to all the three Persons;
whereas the rest belong only to the
Third. One of them only is varied
to express the three Cases; <i>Who</i>,
<i>whose</i><a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>, (that is, <i>who’s</i><a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>) <i>whom</i>:
none of them have different endings
for the Numbers. <i>Who</i>, <i>which</i>,
<i>what</i>, are called Interrogatives, when
they are used in asking questions.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
The two latter of them have no
variation of Number or Case.</p>

<p><i>Own</i>, and <i>self</i>, in the Plural
<i>selves</i>, are joined to the Possessives
<i>my</i>, <i>our</i>, <i>thy</i>, <i>your</i>, <i>his</i>, <i>her</i>, <i>their</i>;
as, <i>my own</i> hand; <i>myself</i>, <i>yourselves</i>;
both of them expressing emphasis,
or opposition; as, “I did it
<i>my own self</i>,” that is, and no one
else: the latter also forming the
Reciprocal Pronoun; as, “he hurt
<i>himself</i>.” <i>Himself</i>, <i>themselves</i>, seem
to be used in the Nominative Case
by corruption instead of <i>his self</i>,
<i>their selves</i>: as, “he came <i>himself</i>;”
“they did it <i>themselves</i>;” where <i>himself</i>,
<i>themselves</i>, cannot be in the
Objective Case. If this be so, <i>self</i>
must be in these instances, not a
Pronoun, but a Noun. Thus Dryden
uses it:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent30">“What I show,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thy <i>self may</i> freely on thy self bestow.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span></p>

<p><i>Ourself</i>, the Plural Pronominal
Adjective with the Singular Substantive,
is peculiar to the Regal
Style.</p>

<p><i>Own</i> is an Adjective; or perhaps
the Participle (<i>owen</i>) of the
obsolete verb <i>owe</i>; to possess; to
be the right owner of a thing.</p>

<p>All Nouns whatever in Grammatical
Construction are of the
Third Person: except when an
address is made to a Person; then
the Noun, answering to the Vocative
Case in Latin, is of the Second
Person.</p>

<h3>ADJECTIVE.</h3>

<p>An Adjective is a word joined to
a Substantive to express its
Quality<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span></p>

<p>In English the Adjective is not
varied on account of Gender,
Number, or Case. The only variation
it admits of is that of the
Degrees of Comparison.</p>

<p>Qualities admit of <i>more</i> and <i>less</i>,
or of different degrees: and the
words that express Qualities have
accordingly proper forms to express
different degrees. When a Quality
is simply expressed, without
any relation to the same in a different
degree, it is called the Positive;
as, <i>wise</i>, <i>great</i>. When it is expressed
with augmentation, or with
reference to a less degree of the
same, it is called the Comparative;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
as, <i>wiser</i>, <i>greater</i>. When it is
expressed as being in the highest
degree of all, it is called the Superlative;
as, <i>wisest</i>, <i>greatest</i>.</p>

<p>So that the simple word, or
Positive, becomes Comparative by
adding <i>r</i> or <i>er</i>; and Superlative by
adding <i>st</i>, or <i>est</i>, to the end of it.
And the Adverbs <i>more</i> and <i>most</i>
placed before the Adjective have
the same effect; as, <i>wise</i>, <i>more wise</i>,
<i>most wise</i><a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>.</p>

<p>Monosyllables, for the most part,
are compared by <i>er</i> and <i>est</i>; and
Dissyllables by <i>more</i> and <i>most</i>: as,
<i>mild</i>, <i>milder</i>, <i>mildest</i>; <i>frugal</i>, <i>more
frugal</i>, <i>most frugal</i>. Dissyllables
ending in <i>y</i> easily admit of <i>er</i> and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
<i>est</i>; as <i>happy</i>, <i>lovely</i>. Words of
more than two syllables hardly ever
admit of <i>er</i> and <i>est</i>.</p>

<p>In some few words the Superlative
is formed by adding the Adverb
<i>most</i> to the end of them: as,
<i>nethermost</i>, <i>uttermost</i>, or <i>utmost</i>, <i>undermost</i>,
<i>uppermost</i>, <i>foremost</i>.</p>

<p>In English, as in most languages,
there are some words of very common
use that are irregular in this
respect: as, <i>good</i>, <i>better</i>, <i>best</i>; <i>bad</i>,
<i>worse</i>, <i>worst</i>; <i>little</i>, <i>less</i><a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>, <i>least</i>;
<i>much</i>, <i>or many</i>, <i>more</i>, <i>most</i>; and a
few others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span></p>

<h3>VERB.</h3>

<p>A <span class="smcap">Verb</span> is a word which signifies
to be, to do, or to suffer.</p>

<p>There are three kinds of Verbs;
Active, Passive, and Neuter Verbs.</p>

<p>A Verb Active expresses an Action,
and necessarily implies an
agent, and an object acted upon:
as, <i>to love</i>; “I love Thomas.”</p>

<p>A Verb Passive expresses a Passion,
or a Suffering, or the receiving
of an Action; and necessarily
implies an Object acted upon, and
an Agent by which it is acted
upon: as, <i>to be loved</i>; “Thomas
is loved by me.”</p>

<p>So when the Agent takes the
lead in the Sentence, the Verb is
Active, and the Object follows:
when the Object takes the lead, the
Verb is Passive, and the Agent
follows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span></p>

<p>A Verb Neuter expresses Being,
or a state or condition of being;
when the Agent and the Object
acted upon coincide, and the event
is properly neither Action nor Passion,
but rather something between
both: as, <i>I am</i>; <i>I walk</i>; <i>I sleep</i>.</p>

<p>The Verb Active is called also
Transitive, because the Action <i>passeth
over</i> to the Object, or hath an
effect upon some other thing: and
the Verb Neuter is called Intransitive,
because the effect is confined
within the Agent, and doth <i>not
pass over</i> to any object.</p>

<p>In English many Verbs are used
both in an Active and a Neuter
signification, the construction only
determining of which kind they are.</p>

<p>In a Verb are to be considered
the Person, the Number, the Time,
and the Mode.</p>

<p>The Verb varies its endings to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
express, or agree with, the different
Persons: as, “I <i>love</i>, Thou <i>lovest</i>,
He <i>loveth</i>, or <i>loves</i>.”</p>

<p>So also to express the different
Numbers of the same Person: as,
“Thou <i>lovest</i>, ye <i>love</i>; He <i>loveth</i>,
they <i>love</i><a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>.”</p>

<p>So likewise to express different
Times: as, “I <i>love</i>, I <i>loved</i>; I
<i>bear</i>, I <i>bore</i>, I have <i>born</i>.”</p>

<p>The Mode is the <i>Manner</i> of representing
the Action or Passion.
When it is simply <i>declared</i>, or a
question is asked concerning it, it
is called the Indicative Mode; when
it is <i>bidden</i>, it is called the Imperative;
when it is <i>subjoined</i> as the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
end or design, or mentioned under
a condition, a supposition, or the
like, for the most part depending
on some other Verb, and having a
Conjunction before it, it is called
the Subjunctive; when it is barely
expressed <i>without any limitation</i> of
person or number, it is called the
Infinitive; and when it is expressed
in a form in which it may be
joined to a Noun as its quality or
accident, <i>partaking</i> thereby of the
nature of an Adjective, it is called
the Participle.</p>

<p>But to express the Time of the
Verb the English uses also the assistance
of other Verbs, called therefore
Auxiliaries, or Helpers; <i>do</i>, <i>be</i>,
<i>have</i>, <i>shall</i>, <i>will</i>: as, “I <i>do</i> love, I
<i>did</i> love; I <i>am</i> loved, I <i>was</i> loved;
I <i>have</i> loved, I <i>have been</i> loved; I
<i>shall</i>, or <i>will</i>, love, or <i>be</i> loved.”</p>

<p>The two principal auxiliaries, <i>to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
have</i>, and <i>to be</i>, are thus varied according
to Person, Number, Time,
and Mode.</p>

<p>Time is Present, Past, or Future.</p>

<p>But in discourse we have often
occasion to speak of Time not only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
as Present, Past, and Future, at large
and indeterminately, but also as such
with some particular distinction and
limitation; that is, as passing, or
finished; as imperfect, or perfect.
This will best be seen in an example
of a Verb laid out and distributed
according to these distinctions
of Time.</p>

<p>To express the Present and Past
Imperfect of the Active and Neuter
Verb the Auxiliary <i>do</i> is sometimes
used: I <i>do</i> (now) love; I <i>did</i> (then)
love.</p>

<p>Thus with very little variation of
the Principal Verb the several circumstances
of Mode and Time are
clearly expressed by the help of the
Auxiliaries, <i>be</i>, <i>have</i>, <i>do</i>, <i>let</i>, <i>may</i>,
<i>can</i>, <i>shall</i>, <i>will</i>.</p>

<p>The peculiar force of the several
Auxiliaries is to be observed.
<i>Do</i> and <i>did</i> mark the Action
itself, or the Time of it<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>, with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
greater force and distinction. They
are also of frequent and almost
necessary use in Interrogative and
Negative Sentences. <i>Let</i> does not
only express permission; but praying,
exhorting, commanding. <i>May</i>
and <i>might</i> express the possibility or
liberty of doing a thing; <i>can</i> and
<i>could</i>, the power. <i>Must</i> is sometimes
called in for a helper, and
denotes necessity. <i>Would</i> expresses
the intention of the doer; <i>should</i>
simply the event. <i>Will</i> in the first
Person singular and plural promises
or threatens; in the second and third
Persons only foretells: <i>shall</i> on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
contrary, in the first Person simply
foretells; in the second and third
Persons commands or threatens<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>.</p>

<p><i>Do</i> and <i>have</i> make the Present
Time; <i>did</i>, <i>had</i>, the Past; <i>shall</i>,
<i>will</i>, the Future: <i>let</i> the Imperative
Mode; <i>may</i>, <i>might</i>, <i>could</i>,
<i>would</i>, <i>should</i>, the Subjunctive.
The Preposition <i>to</i> placed before
the Verb makes the Infinitive Mode.
<i>Have</i>, through its
several Modes and Times, is placed only
before the Perfect Participle; and <i>be</i>, in
like manner, before the Present and Passive
Participles: the rest only
before the Verb itself in its Primary
Form<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span></p>

<p>The Passive Verb is only the Participle
Passive, (which for the most
part is the same with the Indefinite
Past Time Active, and always the
same with the Perfect Participle)
joined to the Auxiliary Verb <i>to be</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
through all its Variations: as, I <i>am
loved</i>; I <i>was loved</i>; I <i>have been
loved</i>; I <i>shall be loved</i>: and so on
through all the Persons, Numbers,
Times, and Modes.</p>

<p>The Neuter Verb is varied like<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
the Active; but, having somewhat
of the Nature of the Passive, admits
in many instances of the Passive
form, retaining still the Neuter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
signification; chiefly in such Verbs
as signify some sort of motion, or
change of place or condition: as, I
<i>am come</i>; I <i>was gone</i>; I <i>am grown</i>;
I <i>was fallen</i><a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>. The Verb <i>am</i> in
this case precisely defines the Time
of the action or event, but does not
change the nature of it; the Passive
form still expressing, not properly
a Passion, but only a state or condition
of Being.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span></p>

<h4>IRREGULAR VERBS.</h4>

<p>In English both the Past Time Active
and the Participle Perfect,
or Passive, are formed by adding to
the Verb <i>ed</i>; or <i>d</i> only when the
Verb ends in <i>e</i>: as, <i>turn</i>, <i>turned</i>;
<i>love</i>, <i>loved</i>. The Verbs that vary
from this rule, in either or in both
cases, are esteemed Irregular.</p>

<p>The nature of our language, the
Accent and Pronunciation of it,
inclines us to contract even all our
Regular Verbs: thus <i>loved</i>, <i>turned</i>,
are commonly pronounced in one
syllable, <i>lov’d</i>, <i>turn’d</i>; and the
second Person which was originally
in three syllables, <i>lovedest</i>, <i>turnedest</i>,
is become a dissyllable, <i>lovedst</i>, <i>turnedst</i>:
for as we generally throw the
accent as far back as possible towards
the first part of the word, (in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
some even to the fourth syllable
from the end,) the stress being laid
on the first syllables, the rest are
pronounced in a lower tone, more
rapidly and indistinctly; and so are
often either wholly dropt, or blended
into one another.</p>

<p>It sometimes happens also, that
the word which arises from a regular
change does not sound easily
or agreeably; sometimes by the rapidity
of our pronunciation the vowels
are shortened or lost; and the consonants
which are thrown together
do not easily coalesce with one another,
and are therefore changed
into others of the same organ, or of
a kindred species: this occasions a
further deviation from the regular
form: thus, <i>loveth</i>, <i>turneth</i>, are
contracted into <i>lov’th</i>, <i>turn’th</i>, and
these for easier pronunciation immediately
become <i>loves</i>, <i>turns</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span></p>

<p>Verbs ending in <i>ch</i>, <i>ck</i>, <i>p</i>, <i>x</i>, <i>ll</i>,
<i>ss</i>, in the Past Time Active and the
Participle Perfect or Passive admit
the change of <i>ed</i> into <i>t</i>; as, <i>snatcht</i>,
<i>checkt</i>, <i>snapt</i>, <i>mixt</i>, dropping also
one of the double letters, <i>dwelt</i>,
<i>past</i>; for <i>snatched</i>, <i>checked</i>, <i>snapped</i>,
<i>mixed</i>, <i>dwelled</i>, <i>passed</i>: those that
end in <i>l</i>, <i>m</i>, <i>n</i>, <i>p</i>, after a diphthong,
moreover shorten the diphthong, or
change it into a single short vowel;
as, <i>dealt</i>, <i>dreamt</i>, <i>meant</i>, <i>felt</i>, <i>slept</i>,
&amp;c: all for the same reason; from
the quickness of the pronunciation,
and because the <i>d</i> after a short
vowel will not easily coalesce with
the preceding consonant. Those
that end in <i>ve</i> change also <i>v</i> into
<i>f</i>; as, <i>bereave</i>, <i>bereft</i>; <i>leave</i>, <i>left</i>;
because likewise <i>v</i> after a short
vowel will not easily coalesce with <i>t</i>.</p>

<p>All these, of which we have hitherto
given examples, are considered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
not as Irregular, but as Contracted
only; and in all of them the
Intire as well as the Contracted
form is used.</p>

<p>The formation of Verbs in English,
both Regular and Irregular, is
derived from the Saxon.</p>

<p>The Irregular Verbs in English
are all Monosyllables, unless Compounded;
and they are for the most
part the same words which are Irregular
Verbs in the Saxon.</p>

<p>As all our Regular Verbs are
subject to some kind of Contraction,
so the first Class of Irregulars is
of those that become so from the
same cause.</p>

<h5>I.<br>Irregulars by Contraction.</h5>

<p>Some Verbs ending in <i>d</i> or <i>t</i> have
the Present, the Past Time, and the
Participle Perfect and Passive, all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
alike, without any variation: as,
Beat, burst<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>, cast, cost, cut, hit,
hurt, knit, let, lift<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>, put, read<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>,
rent, rid, set, shed, shred, shut, slit,
spread, thrust, wet<a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>.</p>

<p>These are Contractions from <i>beated</i>,
<i>bursted</i>, <i>casted</i>, &amp;c; because of
the disagreeable sound of the syllable
<i>ed</i> after <i>d</i> or <i>t</i><a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span></p>

<p>Others in the Past Time, and Participle
Perfect and Passive, vary a
little from the Present by shortening
the diphthong, or changing the
<i>d</i> into <i>t</i>: as, Lead, led; sweat,
swet; meet, met; bleed, bled;
breed, bred; feed, fed; speed, sped;
bend, bent<a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>; lend, lent; rend, rent;
send, sent; spend, spent; build, built<a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>;
geld, gelt<a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>; gild, gilt<a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>; gird, girt<a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>.</p>

<p>Others not ending in <i>d</i> or <i>t</i> are
formed by Contraction; have, <i>had</i>,
for <i>haved</i>; make, <i>made</i>, for <i>maked</i>;
flee, <i>fled</i>, for <i>flee-ed</i>.</p>

<p>The following beside the Contraction
change also the Vowel;
Sell, sold; tell, told; clothe, clad<a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>.</p>

<p>Stand, stood; and dare, durst,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
(which in the Participle hath regularly
<i>dared</i>;) are directly from
the Saxon, <i>standan</i>, <i>stod</i>; <i>dyrran</i>,
<i>dorste</i>.</p>

<h5>II.<br>Irregulars in <i>ght</i>.</h5>

<p>The Irregulars of the Second
Class end in <i>ght</i>, both in the Past
Time and Participle; and change
the vowel or diphthong into <i>au</i> or
<i>ou</i>: they are taken from the Saxon,
in which the termination is <i>hte</i>.</p>

<p><i>Fraught</i> seems rather to be an
Adjective than the Participle of the
Verb <i>to freight</i>, which has regularly
<i>freighted</i>. <i>Raught</i> from <i>reach</i>
is obsolete.</p>

<h5>III.<br>Irregulars in <i>en</i>.</h5>

<p>The Irregulars of the Third Class
form the Past Time by changing
the vowel or diphthong of the Present;
and the Participle Perfect
and Passive by adding the termination
<i>en</i>, beside, for the most part,
the change of the vowel or diphthong.
These also derive their
formation in both parts from the
Saxon.</p>

<p>That all these had originally the

plain from the following considerations.
<i>Drink</i> and <i>bind</i> still retain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
it; <i>drunken</i>, <i>bounden</i>; from the
Saxon, <i>druncen</i>, <i>bunden</i>: and the
rest are manifestly of the same analogy
with these. <i>Begonnen</i>, <i>sonken</i>,
and <i>founden</i>, are used by Chaucer;
and some others of them appear in
their proper shape in the Saxon;
<i>scruncen</i>, <i>spunnen</i>, <i>sprungen</i>, <i>stungen</i>,
<i>wunden</i>. As likewise in the
German, which is only another off-spring
of the Saxon: <i>begunnen</i>, <i>geklungen</i>,
<i>getruncken</i>, <i>gesungen</i>, <i>gesuncken</i>,
<i>gespunnen</i>, <i>gesprungen</i>, <i>gestuncken</i>,
<i>geschwummen</i>, <i>geschwungen</i>.</p>

<p><i>Hangen</i>, and <i>scoten</i>, are the Saxon
originals of the two first Participles;
the latter of which is likewise
still in use in its first form in one
phrase; a <i>shotten</i> herring. <i>Stuck</i>
seems to be a contraction from <i>stucken</i>,
as <i>struck</i> now in use for <i>strucken</i>.
Chaucer hath <i>comen</i> and <i>wonnen</i>:
<i>becommen</i> is even used by Lord
Bacon<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>. And most of them still
subsist intire in the German; <i>gehangen</i>,
<i>kommen</i>, <i>gerunnen</i>, <i>gewonnen</i>.</p>

<p>To this third Class belong the
Defective Verbs, Be, been; and Go,
gone; i. e. goen.</p>

<p>From this Distribution and account
of the Irregular Verbs, if it
be just, it appears, that originally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
there was no exception whatever
from the Rule, That the Participle
Præterit, or Passive, in English ends
in <i>d</i>, <i>t</i>, or <i>n</i>. The first form included
all the Regular Verbs, and
those which are become Irregular
by Contraction ending in <i>t</i>. To
the second properly belonged only
those which end in <i>ght</i>, from the
Saxon Irregulars in <i>hte</i>. To the
third, those from the Saxon Irregulars
in <i>en</i>, which have still, or had
originally, the same termination.</p>

<p>The same Rule affords a proper
foundation for a division of the
English Verbs into Three Conjugations,
of which the three different
Terminations of the Participle
might respectively be the Characteristics.
The Contracted Verbs, whose
Participles now end in <i>t</i>, might perhaps
be best reduced to the first
Conjugation, to which they naturally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
and originally belonged; and
they seem to be of a very different
analogy from those in <i>ght</i>. But as
the Verbs of the first Conjugation
would so greatly exceed in number
those of both the others, which together
make but about 110<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>; and
as those of the third Conjugation
are so various in their form, and so
incapable of being reduced to one
plain Rule; it seems better in practice
to consider the first in <i>ed</i> as the
only Regular form, and the others
as deviations from it; after the example
of the Saxon and German
Grammarians.</p>

<p>To the Irregular Verbs are to be
added the Defective; which are not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
only for the most part Irregular,
but are also wanting in some of
their parts. They are in general
words of most frequent and vulgar
use; in which Custom is apt to get
the better of Analogy. Such are the
Auxiliary Verbs, most of which
are of this number. They are in use
only in some of their Times, and
Modes; and some of them are a
Composition of Times of several
Defective Verbs having the same
signification.</p>

<p>There are not in English so
many as a Hundred Verbs, (being
only the chief part, but not all, of
the Irregulars of the Third Class,)
which have a distinct and different
form for the Past Time Active and
the Participle Perfect or Passive.
The General bent and turn of the
language is towards the other form,
which makes the Past Time and
the Participle the same. This general
inclination and tendency of
the language, seems to have given
occasion to the introducing of a
very great Corruption; by which
the Form of the Past Time is confounded
with that of the Participle
in these Verbs, few in proportion,
which have them quite different
from one another. This confusion
prevails greatly in common<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
discourse, and is too much authorised
by the example of some of our
best Writers<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>. Thus it is said, <i>He
begun</i>, for <i>he began</i>; <i>he run</i>, for
<i>he ran</i>; <i>he drunk</i>, for <i>he drank</i>:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
the Participle being used instead of
the Past Time. And much more
frequently the Past Time instead of
the Participle: as, <i>I had wrote</i>, <i>it
was wrote</i>, for <i>I had written</i>, <i>it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
was written</i>; <i>I have drank</i>, for <i>I
have drunk</i>; <i>bore</i>, for <i>born</i>; <i>chose</i>,
for <i>chosen</i>; <i>bid</i>, for <i>bidden</i>; <i>got</i>, for
<i>gotten</i>; &amp;c. This abuse has been
long growing upon us, and is continually
making further incroachments:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
as it may be observed in
the example of those Irregular Verbs
of the Third Class, which change
<i>i</i> short into <i>a</i> and <i>u</i>; as, Cling,
clang, clung; in which the original
and analogical form of the Past
Time in <i>a</i> is almost grown obsolete;
and, the <i>u</i> prevailing instead
of it, the Past Time is now in most
of them confounded with the Participle.
The Vulgar Translation of
the Bible, which is the best standard
of our language, is free from
this corruption, except in a few instances;
as, <i>hid</i> is used for <i>hidden</i>;
<i>held</i>, for <i>holden</i>, frequently: <i>bid</i>,
for <i>bidden</i>; <i>begot</i>, for <i>begotten</i>, once
or twice: in which, and a few other
like words, it may perhaps be
allowed as a Contraction. And in
some of these Custom has established
it beyond recovery. In the rest
it seems wholly inexcusable. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
absurdity of it will be plainly perceived
in the example of some of
these Verbs, which Custom has not
yet so perverted. We should be immediately
shocked at <i>I have knew</i>,
<i>I have saw</i>, <i>I have gave</i>, &amp;c: but
our ears are grown familiar with <i>I
have wrote</i>, <i>I have drank</i>, <i>I have
bore</i>, &amp;c. which are altogether as
barbarous.</p>

<h3>ADVERB.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Adverbs</span> are <i>added to Verbs</i> and
Adjectives to denote some modification
or circumstance of an action
or quality: as, the manner, order,
time, place, distance, motion,
relation, quantity, quality, comparison,
doubt, affirmation, negation,
demonstration, interrogation.</p>

<p>In English they admit of no Variation;
except some few of them,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
which have the degrees of Comparison:
as,<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> “often, oftener, oftenest;”
“soon, sooner, soonest.”</p>

<p>An Adverb is sometimes joined
to another Adverb to modify or
qualify its meaning; as, “very
much; much too little; not very
prudently.”</p>

<h3>PREPOSITION.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Prepositions</span>, so called because
they are commonly <i>put before</i>
the words to which they are applied,
serve to connect words with one
another, and to shew the relation
between them.</p>

<p>One great use of Prepositions in
English, is to express those relations<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
which in some languages are chiefly
marked by Cases, or the different
endings of the Noun.</p>

<p>Most Prepositions originally denote
the relation of Place, and have
been thence transferred to denote
by similitude other relations. Thus,
<i>out</i>, <i>in</i>, <i>through</i>, <i>under</i>, <i>by</i>, <i>to</i>, <i>from</i>,
<i>of</i>, &amp;c. <i>Of</i> is much the same with
<i>from</i>; “ask <i>of</i> me,” that is, <i>from</i>
me: “made <i>of</i> wood;” “Son <i>of</i>
Philip;” that is, sprung <i>from</i> him.
<i>For</i>, in its primary sense, is <i>pro</i>, <i>loco
alterius</i>, in the stead, or place, of
another. The notion of Place is
very obvious in all the rest.</p>

<h3>CONJUNCTION.</h3>

<p>The Conjunction connects or <i>joins
together</i> Sentences; so as out
of two to make one Sentence.</p>

<p>Thus, “You, <i>and</i> I, <i>and</i> Peter,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
rode to London,” is one Sentence
made up of these three by the
Conjunction <i>and</i> twice employed;
“You rode to London; I rode to
London; Peter rode to London.”
Again, “You <i>and</i> I rode to London,
<i>but</i> Peter staid at home,” is one
Sentence made up of three by the
Conjunctions <i>and</i> and <i>but</i>: both of
which equally connect the Sentences,
but the latter expresses an Opposition
in the Sense. The first is therefore
called a Conjunction Copulative;
the other a Conjunction Disjunctive.</p>

<p>The use of Copulative Conjunctions
is to connect, or to continue,
the Sentence, by expressing an addition,
<i>and</i>; a supposition, or condition,
<i>if</i>, <i>as</i>; a cause, <i>because</i><a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
<i>then</i>; a motive, <i>that</i>; an inference,
<i>therefore</i>; &amp;c.</p>

<p>The use of Disjunctives is to connect
and to continue the Sentence;
but to express Opposition of meaning
in different degrees: as, <i>or</i>, <i>but</i>,
<i>than</i>, <i>altho’</i>, <i>unless</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>INTERJECTION.</h3>

<p>Interjections, so called because
they are <i>thrown in</i> between the
parts of a sentence without making
any other alteration in it, are a kind
of Natural Sounds to express the
affection of the Speaker.</p>

<p>The different Passions have for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
the most part different Interjections
to express them.</p>

<p>The Interjection <i>O</i> placed before
a Substantive expresses more strongly
an address made to that person
or thing; as it marks in Latin what
is called the Vocative Case.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="SENTENCES">SENTENCES.</h2>

</div>

<p>A <span class="smcap">Sentence</span> is an assemblage of
words, expressed in proper
form, and ranged in proper order,
and concurring to make a complete
sense.</p>

<p>Concord, or agreement of words,
is when one word is required to be
in like case, number, gender, or
person, with another.</p>

<p>Regimen, or government, is when
a word causeth a following word to
be in some case, or mode.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span></p>

<p>Sentences are Simple, or Compounded.</p>

<p>A Simple Sentence hath in it
but one Subject, and one Finite
Verb; that is, a Verb in the Indicative,
Imperative, or Subjunctive
Mode.</p>

<p>A Phrase is two or more words
rightly put together in order to
make a part of a Sentence; and
sometimes making a whole Sentence.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The most common <span class="smcap">Phrases</span>
used in simple Sentences are as follows:</p>

<p>1st Phrase: The Substantive before
a Verb Active, Passive, or Neuter;
when it is said what thing
<i>is</i>, <i>does</i>, or <i>is done</i>: as, “I am;”
“Thou writest;” “Thomas is
loved:” where <i>I</i>, <i>Thou</i>, <i>Thomas</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
are the Nominative<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> Cases; and answer
to the question <i>who</i>, or <i>what?</i>
as, “Who is loved? Thomas.” And
the Verb agrees with the Nominative
Case in number and person<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
as, <i>Thou</i> being the Second Person
Singular, the Verb <i>writest</i> is so too.</p>

<p>2d Phrase: The Substantive after
a Verb Neuter or Passive; when
it is said, that such a thing <i>is</i>, or <i>is
made</i>, or <i>thought</i>, or <i>called</i>, such <i>another
thing</i>; or, when the Substantive
after the Verb is spoken of the same
thing or person with the Substantive
before the Verb: as, “a calf
becomes an ox;” “Plautus is accounted
a Poet;” “I am He.”
Here the latter Substantive is in the
Nominative Case as well as the former;
and the Verb is said to govern
the Nominative Case: or, the
latter Substantive may be said to
agree in Case with the former.</p>

<p>3d Phrase: The Adjective after
a Verb Neuter or Passive, in like
manner: as, “Life <i>is short</i>, and
Art <i>is long</i>.” “Exercise <i>is esteemed
wholesome</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span></p>

<p>4th Phrase: The Substantive after
a Verb Active, or Transitive:
as when one thing is said to <i>act</i>
upon, or <i>do</i> something to another:
as, “to open a door;” “to build
a house;” “Alexander conquered
the Persians.” Here the thing acted
upon is in the Objective<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> Case; as
it appears plainly when it is expressed
by the Pronoun, which has
a proper termination for that Case;
“Alexander conquered <i>them</i>;” and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
the Verb is said to govern the Objective
Case.</p>

<p>5th Phrase: A Verb following
another Verb; as, “boys love to
play:” where the latter Verb is in
the Infinitive Mode.</p>

<p>6th Phrase: When one thing is
said to belong to another; as, “Milton’s
poems:” where the thing to
which the other belongs is placed
first, and is in the Possessive Case;
or else last with the Preposition <i>of</i>
before it; as, “the poems of Milton.”</p>

<p>7th Phrase: When another Substantive
is added to express and
explain the former more fully; as,
“Paul the Apostle;” “King
George:” where they are both in
the same case; and the latter is said
to be put in Apposition to the former.</p>

<p>8th Phrase: When the quality<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
of the Substantive is expressed by
adding an Adjective to it: as, “a
wise man;” “a black horse.” Participles
have the nature of Adjectives;
as, “a learned man;” “a
loving father.”</p>

<p>9th Phrase: An Adjective with
a Verb in the Infinitive Mode following
it: as, “worthy to die;”
“fit to be trusted.”</p>

<p>10th Phrase: When a circumstance
is added to a Verb, or to an
Adjective, by an Adverb: as, “you
read well;” “he is very prudent.”</p>

<p>11th Phrase: When a circumstance
is added to a Verb or an
Adjective by a Substantive with a
Preposition before it: as, “I write
for you;” “he reads with care;”
“studious of praise;” “ready for
mischief.”</p>

<p>12th Phrase: When the same
Quality in different Subjects is compared;
the Adjective in the Positive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
having after it the Conjunction
<i>as</i>, in the Comparative the Conjunction
<i>than</i>, and in the Superlative
the Preposition <i>of</i>: as, “white
as snow;” “wiser than I;” “greatest
of all.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The <span class="smcap">Principal parts</span> of a Simple
Sentence are the Agent, the Attribute,
and the Object. The Agent
is the thing chiefly spoken of; the
Attribute is the thing or action affirmed
or denied of it; and the
Object is the thing affected by such
action.</p>

<p>In English the Nominative Case
denoting the Agent, usually goes
before the Verb, or Attribution,
and the Objective Case, denoting
the Object, follows the Verb; and
it is the order that determines the
cases in Nouns: as, “Alexander
conquered the Persians.” But the
Pronoun, having a proper form for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
each of those cases, sometimes when
it is in the Objective Case is placed
before the Verb, and when it is in
the Nominative Case follows the
Object and Verb: as, “Whom ye
ignorantly worship, <i>him declare I</i>
unto you.” And the Nominative
Case is sometimes placed after a
Verb Neuter: as, “Upon thy right
hand <i>did stand the Queen</i>:” “On
a sudden <i>appeared the King</i>.” And
frequently with the Adverbs <i>there</i>
and then: as, “There <i>was a man</i>:”
“Then <i>came</i> unto him <i>the Pharisees</i>.”
The reason of it is plain:
the Neuter Verb not admitting of
an Objective Case after it, no ambiguity
of case can arise from such
a position of the Noun.</p>

<p><i>Who</i>, <i>which</i>, <i>what</i>, and the Relative
<i>that</i>, though in the Objective
Case, are always placed before the
Verb; as are also their Compounds,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
<i>whoever</i>, <i>whosoever</i>, &amp;c: as, “He
<i>whom</i> you <i>seek</i>.” “This is <i>what</i>, or
the thing <i>which</i>, or <i>that</i>, you <i>want</i>.”
“<i>Whomsoever</i> you please <i>to appoint</i>.”</p>

<p>When the Verb is a Passive, the
Agent and Object change places in
the Sentence; and the thing acted
upon is in the Nominative Case,
and the Agent is accompanied with
a Preposition: as, “The Persians
were conquered by Alexander.”</p>

<p>A Noun of Multitude<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>, or signifying<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
many; and two Nouns in the
Singular Number, joined together
by a Conjunction Copulative; have
Verbs, Nouns, and Pronouns, agreeing
with them in the Plural Number:
as, “When the King’s trump,
the <i>mob are</i> for the King.” Dryden.
“<i>Socrates and Plato were</i> wise;
<i>they were</i> the most eminent <i>Philosophers</i>
of Greece.”</p>

<p>If the Singulars so joined together
are of several Persons, in making
the Plural Pronoun agree with them
in Person, the second Person takes
place of the third, and the first of
both: “<i>He and You and I</i> won it
at the hazard of <i>our</i> lives: <i>You and
He</i> shared it between <i>you</i>.”</p>

<p>The Verb <i>to Be</i> has always a
Nominative Case after it; as, “it
<i>was I</i>, and not <i>He</i>, that did
it:” unless it be in the Infinitive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
Mode; “though you took it <i>to be
Him</i><a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>.”</p>

<p>The Adverbs <i>when</i>, <i>while</i>, <i>after</i>,
&amp;c. being left out, the Phrase is
formed with the Participle independently
of the rest of the Sentence:
as, “The doors being shut,
Jesus stood in the midst.” This is
called the Case Absolute. And the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
Case is in English always the Nominative:
as,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“God from the mount of Sinai, whose gray top</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shall tremble, <i>He descending</i><a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>, will himself,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Ordain them laws.”</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span></p>

<p><i>To</i> before a Verb is the sign of
the Infinitive Mode: but there are
some few Verbs, which have other
Verbs following them in the Infinitive
Mode without the sign <i>to</i>:
as, bid, dare, need, make, see, hear;
and, let, have, not used as Auxiliaries:
as, “I bade him do it; you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
dare not do it; I saw him<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> do it;
I heard him say it.”</p>

<p>The Infinitive Mode has much
of the nature of a Substantive, expressing
the Action itself which the
Verb signifies; as the Participle has
the nature of an Adjective. Thus
the Infinitive Mode does the office
of a Substantive in different cases;
in the Nominative; as, “<i>to play
is</i> pleasant:” in the Objective; as,
“boys <i>love to play</i>.” In Greek it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
admits of the Article through all its
cases, with the Preposition in the
Oblique cases: in English the Article
is not wanted, but the Preposition
may be used: “For <i>to will
is</i> present with me; but <i>to perform</i>
that which is good I find not<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>.”
“All their works they do <i>for to be
seen</i> of men<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“For not <i>to have been dip’d</i> in Lethe’s lake</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Could save the Son of Thetis <i>from to die</i>.”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right">Spenser.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Perhaps therefore the Infinitive and
the Participle might be more properly
called the Substantive Mode
and the Adjective Mode<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>.</p>

<p>The Participle with a Preposition
before it, and still retaining its Government,
answers to what is called
in Latin the Gerund: as, “Happiness
is to be attained, by avoiding
evil, and by doing good; by seeking
peace, and by pursuing it.”</p>

<p>The Participle, with an Article
before it, and the Preposition <i>of</i> after
it, becomes a Substantive, expressing
the action itself which the
Verb signifies<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>: as, “These are the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
Rules of Grammar, by <i>the observing
of</i> which you may avoid mistakes.”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
Or it may be expressed by the Participle,
or Gerund; “by <i>observing</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
which:” not, “by <i>observing of</i>
which;” nor, “by <i>the observing</i>
which:” for either of those two
Phrases would be a confounding of
two distinct forms.</p>

<p>I will add another example, and
that of the best authority: “The
middle station of life seems to be
the most advantageously situated
for <i>the gaining of</i> wisdom. Poverty
turns our thoughts too much
upon <i>the supplying of</i> our wants,
and riches <i>upon enjoying our</i> superfluities.”
Addison, Spect. Nᵒ
464.</p>

<p>The Participle frequently becomes
altogether an Adjective; when it is
joined to a Substantive merely to
denote its quality; without any
respect to time; expressing, not an
Action, but a Habit; and as such
it admits of the degrees of Comparison:
as, “a learned, a more learned,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
a most learned, man; a loving,
more loving, most loving, father.”</p>

<p>Simple Sentences are 1. Explicative,
or explaining: 2. Interrogative,
or asking: 3. Imperative,
or commanding<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span></p>

<p>1. An Explicative Sentence is
when a thing is said to be, or not
to be; to do, or not to do; to suffer,
or not to suffer; in a direct
manner; as in the foregoing examples.
If the Sentence be Negative,
the Adverb <i>not</i> is placed after the
Auxiliary, or after the Verb itself
when it has no Auxiliary: as, “it
<i>did not</i> touch him;” or, “it <i>touched</i>
him <i>not</i><a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>.”</p>

<p>2. In an Interrogative Sentence,
or when a Question is asked, the
Nominative Case follows the Principal
Verb, or the Auxiliary: as,
“<i>was it</i> he?” “<i>did Alexander</i>
conquer the Persians?” So that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
Question depends intirely on the
order of the words<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>.</p>

<p>3. In an Imperative Sentence,
when a thing is commanded to be,
to do, to suffer, or not, the Nominative
Case follows the Verb or the
Auxiliary: as, “Go, thou traytor;”
or, “do thou go:” or the Auxiliary
<i>let</i> with the Objective<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> Case after it
is used: as, “Let us be gone<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span></p>

<p>The Adjective in English, having
no variation of Gender or Number,
cannot but agree with the Substantive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
in those respects; some of the
Pronominal Adjectives only excepted,
which have the Plural Number:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
as, <i>these</i>, <i>those</i>, and <i>they</i>; which
must agree in Number<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> with their
Substantives.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span></p>

<p>The Adjective generally goes before
the Noun: as, “a wise man;
a good horse;” unless something
depend on the Adjective; as, “food
convenient for me:” or the Adjective
be emphatical; as, “Alexander
the great.” And the Article
goes before the Adjective: except
the Adjectives <i>such</i> and <i>many</i>, and
others subjoined to the Adverbs <i>so</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
<i>as</i>, and <i>how</i>: as, “<i>such a</i> man;”
“<i>many a</i> man;” “so <i>good a</i> man;”
“as <i>good a</i> man as ever lived;” “how
<i>beautiful a</i> prospect is here!” And
sometimes when there are two or
more Adjectives joined to the Noun:
as, “a man learned and religious.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Every Verb, except in the Infinitive
or the Participle, hath its
Nominative Case, either expressed

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span></p>

<p>Every Nominative Case, except
the Case Absolute, and when an
address is made to a Person, belongs
to some Verb, either expressed or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
implied<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>: as in the answer to a
Question; “Who wrote this book;
Cicero:” that is, “Cicero <i>wrote
it</i>.” Or when the Verb is understood;
as,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
“To whom thus Adam:” that is,
<i>spake</i>.</p>

<p>Every Possessive Case supposes
some Noun to which it belongs:
as when we say, “St. Paul’s, or
St. James’s,” we mean St. Paul’s
<i>Church</i>, or St. James’s <i>Palace</i>.</p>

<p>Every Adjective has relation to
some Substantive, either expressed
or implied: as, “The Twelve,”
that is, <i>Apostles</i>; “the wife, the
elect,” that is, <i>persons</i>.</p>

<p>In some instances the Adjective
becomes a Substantive, and has an
Adjective joined to it: as, “the
chief Good;” “Evil, be Thou my
Good!”<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prepositions</span> have a Government
of Cases; and in English they
always require the Objective Case<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
after them: as, “<i>with him</i>; <i>from
her</i>; <i>to me</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>The Preposition is often separated
from the Relative which it
governs, and joined to the Verb at
the end of the Sentence, or of some
member of it: as, “Horace is an
author, <i>whom</i> I am much delighted
<i>with</i>.” “The<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> world is too well
bred to shock authors with a truth,
<i>which</i> generally their booksellers are
the first that inform them <i>of</i>.” This
is an Idiom which our language is
strongly inclined to; it prevails in
common conversation, and suits
very well with the familiar style in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
writing; but the placing of the
Preposition before the Relative is
more graceful, as well as more perspicuous;
and agrees much better
with the solemn and elevated Style.</p>

<p>Verbs are often compounded of
a Verb and a Preposition; as, <i>to
uphold</i>, <i>to outweigh</i>, <i>to overlook</i>: and
this composition sometimes gives a
new sense to the Verb; as, <i>to understand</i>,
<i>to withdraw</i>, <i>to forgive</i><a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>.
But in English the Preposition is
more frequently placed after the
Verb, and separate from it, like an
Adverb; in which situation it is no
less apt to affect the sense of it, and
to give it a new meaning; and may
still be considered as belonging to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
the Verb, and a part of it. As,
<i>to cast</i> is to throw; but <i>to cast up</i>,
or to compute, <i>an account</i>, is quite
a different thing: thus, <i>to fall on</i>,
<i>to bear out</i>, <i>to give over</i>; &amp;c. So
that the meaning of the Verb, and
the propriety of the phrase, depend
on the Preposition subjoined<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span></p>

<p>As the Preposition subjoined to
the Verb hath the construction and
nature of an Adverb, so the Adverbs
<i>here</i>, <i>there</i>, <i>where</i>, with a
Preposition subjoined, as <i>hereof</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
<i>therewith</i>, <i>whereupon</i><a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>, have the
construction and nature of Pronouns.</p>

<p>The Prepositions <i>to</i> and <i>for</i> are
often understood; as, “give me<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
the book; get me some paper;”
that is, <i>to me</i>, <i>for me</i><a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>.</p>

<p>Two or more Simple Sentences,
joined together by one or more <span class="smcap">Connective
Words</span>, become a Compounded
Sentence.</p>

<p>There are two sorts of words
which connect Sentences: 1. Relatives;
2. Conjunctions.</p>

<p>Examples: 1. “Blessed is the
man, <i>who</i> feareth the Lord.” 2. “Life
is short, <i>and</i> art is long.” 1. and 2.
“Blessed is the Man, <i>who</i> feareth
the Lord, <i>and</i> keepeth his commandments.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The <span class="smcap">Relatives</span> <i>who</i>, <i>which</i>, <i>that</i>,
having no variation of gender or
number, cannot but agree with
their Antecedents. <i>Who</i> is appropriated
to persons; and so may be
accounted Masculine and Feminine
only: <i>which</i> is used of things only;
and so may be accounted Neuter.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
But formerly they were both indifferently
used of persons: “Our
Father, <i>which</i> art in heaven.” <i>That</i>
is used indifferently both of persons
and things: but perhaps would be
more properly confined to the latter.
<i>What</i> includes both the Antecedent
and the Relative: as,
“This was <i>what</i> he wanted;” that
is, “<i>the thing which</i> he wanted<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>.”</p>

<p>The Relative is the Nominative
Case to the Verb, when no other
Nominative comes between it and
the Verb: but when another Nominative
comes between it and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
Verb, the Relative is governed by
some word in its own member of
the Sentence: as, “The God <i>who</i>
preserveth me; <i>whose</i> I am, and
<i>whom</i> I serve<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>.”</p>

<p>Every Relative must have an
Antecedent to which it refers, either
expressed, or understood: as,
“<i>Who</i> steals my purse, steals trash:”
that is, <i>the man, who</i> ⸺.</p>

<p>The Relative is of the same person
with the Antecedent; and the
Verb agrees with it accordingly:
as, “Who is <i>this, that cometh</i> from
Edom; <i>this that is</i> glorious in his
apparel?⸺<i>I that speak</i> in righteousness.”
Isaiah lxiii. 1. “O Shepherd
of Israel, <i>Thou that leadest</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
Joseph like a flock; <i>Thou that
dwellest</i> between the Cherubims.”
Ps. lxxx. 1.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>The Relative is often understood,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
or omitted: as, “The man
I love;” that is, “<i>whom</i> I love<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>.”</p>

<p>The accuracy and clearness of
the Sentence depend very much
upon the proper and determinate
use of the Relative, so that it may<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
readily present its Antecedent to
the mind of the hearer or reader
without any obscurity or ambiguity.
The same may be observed of the
Pronoun and the Noun, which by
some are called also the Relative
and the Antecedent<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjunctions</span> have sometimes
a Government of Modes. Some
Conjunctions require the Indicative,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
some the Subjunctive Mode
after them: others have no influence
at all on the Mode.</p>

<p>Hypothetical, Conditional, Concessive,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
and Exceptive Conjunctions
seem to require properly the Subjunctive
Mode after them: as, <i>if</i>,
<i>tho’</i>, <i>unless</i>, <i>except</i>, <i>whether—or</i>, &amp;c.
but by use they often admit of the
Indicative. Examples: “<i>If</i> thou<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
<i>be</i> the Son of God.” Matt. iv. 3.
“<i>Tho’</i> he <i>slay</i> me, yet will I put
my trust in him.” Job xiii. 15.
“<i>Unless</i> he <i>wash</i> his flesh.” Lev.
xxii. 6. “No power, <i>except</i> it <i>were</i>
given from above.” John xix. 11.
“<i>Whether</i> it <i>were</i> I <i>or</i> they, so we
preach.” 1 Cor. xv. 11. The Subjunctive
in these instances implies
something contingent or doubtful;
the Indicative would express a more
absolute and determinate sense.</p>

<p><i>That</i> expressing the motive or
end has the Subjunctive Mode, with
<i>may</i>, <i>might</i>, <i>should</i>, after it.</p>

<p><i>Lest</i>; and <i>that</i> with a Negative
following it; and <i>if</i> with <i>but</i> following
it; necessarily require the
Subjunctive Mode: Examples; “Let
him that standeth, take heed, <i>lest</i>
he <i>fall</i>.” 1 Cor. x. 12. “Take
heed, <i>that</i> thou <i>speak not</i> to Jacob.”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
Gen. xxxi. 24. “<i>If</i> he <i>do but</i>
touch the hills, they shall smoke.”
Ps. civ. 32.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>Other Conjunctions, expressing
a Continuation, an Addition, an
Inference, &amp;c. being of a positive
and absolute nature, require the Indicative
Mode; or rather leave the
Mode to be determined by the other
circumstances and conditions of the
Sentence.</p>

<p>When the Qualities of different
things are compared, the latter Noun
is governed, not by the Conjunction
<i>than</i>, or <i>as</i>, (for a Conjunction has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
no Government of Cases,) but by
the Verb or the Preposition, expressed,
or understood. As, “Thou
art wiser than <i>I</i> [am.]” “You
are not so tall as <i>I</i> [am.]” “You
think him handsomer than [you
think] <i>me</i>; and you love him more
than [you love] <i>me</i>.” In all other
instances, if you complete the Sentence
in like manner, by supplying
the part which is understood,
the Case of the latter Noun will be
determined. Thus, “Plato observes,
that God geometrizes; and
the same thing was observed before
by a wiser man than <i>he</i>:” that is,
than <i>he was</i>. “It was well expressed
by Plato; but more elegantly
by Solomon than <i>him</i>:” that is,
than <i>by him</i><a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span></p>

<p>The Conjunction <i>that</i> is often
omitted and understood: as, “I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
beg you would come to me:”
“See, thou do it not:” that is,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
“<i>that</i> you would;” “<i>that</i> thou
do<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>.”</p>

<p>The Nominative Case following
the Auxiliary, or the Verb itself,
sometimes supplies the place of the
Conjunctions <i>if</i> and <i>tho’</i>: as, “Had
he done this, he had escaped:”
“Charm he never so<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> wisely:” that
is, “<i>if</i> he had done this;” “<i>tho’</i>
he charm.”</p>

<p>Some Conjunctions have their
Correspondent Conjunctions belonging<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
to them; so that in the
subsequent Member of the Sentence
the latter answers to the former:
as, <i>although</i> ⸺, <i>yet</i>, or <i>nevertheless</i>;
<i>whether</i> ⸺, <i>or</i>; <i>either</i> ⸺,
<i>or</i>; <i>neither</i> ⸺, <i>nor</i>; <i>as</i> ⸺,
<i>as</i>; expressing a Comparison
of equality; “<i>as</i> white <i>as</i>
snow:” <i>as</i> ⸺, <i>so</i>; expressing a
Comparison sometimes of equality;
“<i>as</i> the stars, <i>so</i> shall thy seed
be;” that is, equal in number: but
most commonly a Comparison in
respect of quality; “and it shall
be, <i>as</i> with the people, <i>so</i> with the
priest; <i>as</i> with the servant, <i>so</i> with
his master:” “<i>as</i> is the good, <i>so</i>
is the sinner; <i>as</i> the one dieth, <i>so</i>
dieth the other:” that is, in like
manner: <i>so</i> ⸺, <i>as</i>; with a Verb
expressing a Comparison of quality;
“To see thy glory, <i>so as</i> I have
seen thee in the sanctuary:” but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
with a Negative and an Adjective,
a Comparison in respect of quantity;
as, “Pompey had eminent
abilities: but he was not either <i>so</i>
eloquent and politic a statesman, or
<i>so</i> brave and skilful a general; nor
was he upon the whole <i>so</i> great a

<h2 class="nobreak" id="PUNCTUATION">PUNCTUATION.</h2>

</div>

<p>Punctuation is the art of marking
in writing the several pauses,
or rests, between sentences, and the
parts of sentences, according to their
proper quantity or proportion, as
they are expressed in a just and accurate
pronunciation.</p>

<p>As the several articulate sounds,
the syllables and words, of which
sentences consist, are marked by
Letters; so the rests and pauses between
sentences and their parts are
marked by Points.</p>

<p>But, tho’ the several articulate
sounds are pretty fully and exactly
marked by Letters of known and
determinate power; yet the several
pauses, which are used in a just pronunciation
of discourse, are very
imperfectly expressed by Points.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span></p>

<p>For the different degrees of connexion
between the several parts of
sentences, and the different pauses
in a just pronunciation, which express
those degrees of connexion according
to their proper value, admit
of great variety; but the whole
number of Points, which we have
to express this variety, amounts
only to Four.</p>

<p>Hence it is, that we are under a
necessity of expressing pauses of the
same quantity, on different occasions,
by different points; and more frequently
of expressing pauses of different
quantity by the same points.</p>

<p>So that the doctrine of Punctuation
must needs be very imperfect:
few precise rules can be given,
which will hold without exception
in all cases; but much must be left
to the judgement and taste of the
writer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span></p>

<p>On the other hand, if a greater
number of marks were invented to
express all the possible different
pauses of pronunciation; the doctrine
of them would be very perplexed
and difficult, and the use
of them would rather embarass than
assist the reader.</p>

<p>It remains therefore, that we be
content with the Rules of Punctuation,
laid down with as much exactness
as the nature of the subject will
admit; such as may serve for a general
direction, to be accommodated
to different occasions, and to be
supplied where deficient by the
writers judgement.</p>

<p>The several degrees of Connexion
between Sentences, and between
their principal constructive parts,
Rhetoricians have considered under
the following distinctions, as the
most obvious and remarkable: the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
Period, Colon, Semicolon, and
Comma.</p>

<p>The Period is the whole Sentence,
compleat in itself, wanting
nothing to make a full and perfect
sense, and not connected in
construction with a subsequent Sentence.</p>

<p>The Colon, or Member, is a
chief constructive part, or greater
division, of a Sentence.</p>

<p>The Semicolon, or Half-member,
is a less constructive part, or subdivision
of a Sentence or Member.</p>

<p>A Sentence or Member is again
subdivided into Commas, or Segments;
which are the least constructive
parts of a Sentence, or
Member, in this way of considering
it; for the next subdivision would
be the resolution of it into Phrases
and Words.</p>

<p>The Grammarians have followed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
this division of the Rhetoricians,
and have appropriated to each of
these distinctions its mark, or Point;
which takes its name from the part
of the Sentence which it is employed
to distinguish; as follows:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>The Period</td>
    <td>}</td>
    <td rowspan="4" class="valign">is thus marked</td>
    <td>{</td>
    <td>.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The Colon</td>
    <td>}</td>
    <td>{</td>
    <td>:</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The Semicolon</td>
    <td>}</td>
    <td>{</td>
    <td>;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The Comma</td>
    <td>}</td>
    <td>{</td>
    <td>,</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The proportional quantity or time
of the Points with respect to one
another is determined by the following
general rule: The Period is
a pause in quantity or duration
double of the Colon; the Colon is
double of the Semicolon; and the
Semicolon is double of the Comma.
So that they are in the same proportion
to one another as the Semibrief,
the Minim, the Crotchet, and
the Quaver, in Music. The precise
quantity or duration of each<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
Pause or Note cannot be defined;
for that varies with the Time; and
both in Discourse and Music the
same Composition may be rehearsed
in a quicker or a slower Time: but
in Music the proportion between
the Notes remains ever the same;
and in Discourse, if the Doctrine
of Punctuation were exact, the proportion
between the Pauses would
be ever invariable.</p>

<p>The Points then being designed
to express the Pauses, which depend
on the different degrees of connexion
between Sentences, and between
their principal constructive
parts; to understand the meaning
of the Points, and to know how to
apply them properly, we must consider
the nature of a Sentence, as
divided into its principal constructive
parts; and the degrees of connexion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
between those parts, upon
which such division of it depends.</p>

<p>To begin with the least of these
principal constructive parts, the
Comma. In order the more clearly to
determine the proper application of
the Point which marks it, we must
distinguish between an Imperfect
Phrase, a Simple Sentence, and a
Compounded Sentence.</p>

<p>An Imperfect Phrase contains no
assertion, or does not amount to a
Proposition or Sentence.</p>

<p>A Simple Sentence has but one
Subject and one finite Verb.</p>

<p>A Compounded Sentence has
more than one Subject or one finite
Verb, either expressed or understood;
or it consists of two or
more simple Sentences connected
together.</p>

<p>In a Sentence, the Subject and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
the Verb may be each of them accompanied
with several Adjuncts;
as the Object, the End, the Circumstances
of Time, Place, Manner,
and the like; and this either
immediately, or mediately, that is,
by being connected with some
thing, which is connected with some
other; and so on.</p>

<p>If the several Adjuncts affect the
Subject or the Verb in a different
manner, they are only so many
Imperfect Phrases, and the Sentence
is Simple.</p>

<p>A Simple Sentence admits of no
Point, by which it may be divided,
or distinguished into parts.</p>

<p>If the several Adjuncts affect the
Subject or the Verb in the same
manner, they may be resolved into
so many Simple Sentences: the Sentence
then becomes Compounded,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
and it must be divided into its parts
by Points.</p>

<p>For if there are several Subjects
belonging in the same manner to
one Verb, or several Verbs belonging
in the same manner to one Subject,
the Subjects and Verbs are still
to be accounted equal in number:
for every Verb must have its Subject,
and every Subject its Verb;
and every one of the Subjects, or
Verbs, should or may have its point
of distinction.</p>

<h3>EXAMPLES.</h3>

<p>“The passion for praise produces
excellent effects in women of sense.”
Addison, Spect. Nᵒ 73. In this
Sentence <i>passion</i> is the Subject, and
<i>produces</i> the Verb; each of which
is accompanied and connected with
its adjuncts. The Subject is not
passion in general, but a particular<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
passion determined by its Adjunct
of Specification, as we may call it,
the passion for praise. So likewise
the Verb is immediately connected
with its object, <i>excellent effects</i>; and
mediately, that is, by the intervention
of the word <i>effects</i>, with <i>women</i>,
the Subject in which these effects
are produced; which again is
connected with its Adjunct of Specification;
for it is not meant of
women in general, but of women
of sense only. Lastly it is to be observed,
that these several Adjuncts
are connected with the Verb each
in a different manner; namely, with
<i>effects</i>, as the object; with <i>women</i>,
as the subject of them; with <i>sense</i>,
as the quality or characteristic of
those women. The Adjuncts therefore
are only so many imperfect
Phrases; the Sentence is a Simple
Sentence, and admits of no Point,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
by which it may be distinguished
into parts.</p>

<p>“The Passion for praise, which
is so very vehement in the fair sex,
produces excellent effects in women
of sense.” Here a new Verb is introduced,
accompanied with Adjuncts
of its own; and the Subject
is repeated by the Relative Pronoun
<i>which</i>. It now becomes a
Compounded Sentence, made up
of two Simple Sentences, one of
which is inserted in the middle of
the other; it must therefore be distinguished
into its component parts
by a Point placed on each side of
the additional Sentence.</p>

<p>“How many instances have we
[in the fair sex] of chastity, fidelity,
devotion? How many Ladies
distinguish themselves by the education
of their children, care of
their families, and love of their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
husbands; which are the great qualities
and achievements of woman-kind:
as the making of war, the
carrying on of traffic, the administration
of justice, are those by
which men grow famous, and get
themselves a name?” Ibid.</p>

<p>In the first of these two Sentences
the Adjuncts <i>chastity</i>, <i>fidelity</i>,
<i>devotion</i>, are connected with the Verb
by the word <i>instances</i> in the same
manner, and in effect make so many
distinct Sentences: “how many
instances have we of chastity? how
many instances have we of fidelity?
how many instances have we of devotion?”
They must therefore be
separated from one another by a
Point. The same may be said of
the Adjuncts “education of their
children, &amp;c” in the former part of
the next Sentence: as likewise of
the several Subjects, “the making<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
of war, &amp;c” in the latter part;
which have in effect each their
Verb; for each of these “is an
atchievement by which men grow
famous.”</p>

<p>As Sentences themselves are divided
into Simple and Compounded,
so the members of sentences may
be divided likewise into Simple and
Compounded members: for whole
Sentences, whether Simple or Compounded,
may become members of
other Sentences by means of some
additional connexion.</p>

<p>Simple members of Sentences
closely connected together in one
Compound member or sentence,
are distinguished or separated by a
Comma: as in the foregoing examples.</p>

<p>So likewise the Case Absolute;
Nouns in Apposition, when consisting
of many terms; the Participle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
with something depending on
it; are to be distinguished by the
Comma: for they may be resolved
into Simple members.</p>

<p>When an address is made to a
person, the Noun, answering to the
Vocative Case in Latin, is distinguished
by a Comma.</p>

<h3>EXAMPLES.</h3>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“This said, He form’d thee, Adam; thee, O man,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Dust of the ground.”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Now Morn, her rosy steps in th’ eastern clime</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Advancing, sow’d the earth with orient pearl.”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right">Milton.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Two Nouns, or two Adjectives,
connected by a single Copulative or
Disjunctive, are not separated by a
Point: but when there are more
than two, or where the Conjunction
is understood, they must be distinguished
by a Comma.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span></p>

<p>Simple members connected by
Relatives and Comparatives are for
the most part distinguished by a
Comma: but when the members
are short in Comparative Sentences;
and when two members are closely
connected by a Relative, restraining
the general notion of the Antecedent
to a particular sense; the pause
becomes almost insensible, and the
Comma is better omitted.</p>

<h3>EXAMPLES.</h3>

<p>“Raptures, transports, and extasies
are the rewards which they confer:
sighs and tears, prayers and
broken hearts, are the offerings
which are paid to them.” Addison,
Ibid.</p>

<p>“What is sweeter than honey? and

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span></p>

<p>A member of a Sentence, whether
Simple or Compounded, that
requires a greater pause than a
Comma, yet does not of itself make
a compleat Sentence, but is followed
by something closely depending
on it, may be distinguished by a
Semicolon.</p>

<h3>EXAMPLE.</h3>

<p>“But as this passion for admiration,
when it works according to
reason, improves the beautiful part
of our species in every thing that is
laudable; so nothing is more destructive
to them, when it is governed
by vanity and folly.” Addison, ibid.</p>

<p>Here the whole Sentence is divided
into two parts by the Semicolon;
each of which parts are
Compounded Members, divided
into their Simple Members by Commas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span></p>

<p>A member of a Sentence, whether
Simple or Compounded, which
of itself would make a compleat
Sentence, and so requires a greater
pause than a Semicolon, yet is followed
by an additional part making
a more full and perfect Sense, may
be distinguished by a Colon.</p>

<h3>EXAMPLE.</h3>

<p>“Were all books reduced to
their quintessence, many a bulky
author would make his appearance
in a penny paper: there would
be scarce any such thing in nature
as a folio: the works of an
age would be contained on a few
shelves: not to mention millions of
volumes, that would be utterly annihilated.”
Addison, Spect. Nᵒ 124.</p>

<p>Here the whole Sentence is divided
into four parts by Colons:
the first and last of which are Compounded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
Members, each divided by
a Comma; the second and third
are Simple Members.</p>

<p>When a Semicolon has preceded,
and a greater pause is still necessary;
a Colon may be employed,
tho’ the Sentence be incompleat.</p>

<p>The Colon is also commonly
used, when an Example, or a
Speech is introduced.</p>

<p>When a Sentence is so far perfectly
finished, as not to be connected
in construction with the following
Sentence, it is marked with a Period.</p>

<p>In all cases the proportion of the
several Points in respect to one another
is rather to be regarded, than
their supposed precise quantity, or
proper office, when taken separately.</p>

<p>Beside the Points which mark
the pauses in discourse, there are
others which denote a different<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
modulation of the voice in correspondence
with the sense. These
are</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>The Interrogation Point</td>
    <td>}</td>
    <td rowspan="3" class="valign">thus marked</td>
    <td>{</td>
    <td>?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The Exclamation Point</td>
    <td>}</td>
    <td>{</td>
    <td>!</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The Parenthesis</td>
    <td>}</td>
    <td>{</td>
    <td>()</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The Interrogation and Exclamation
Points are sufficiently explained
by their names: they are
indeterminate as to their quantity
or time, and may be equivalent in
that respect to a Semicolon, a Colon,
or a Period, as the sense requires.
They mark an Elevation
of the voice.</p>

<p>The Parenthesis incloses in the
body of a Sentence a member inserted
into it, which is neither necessary
to the Sense, nor at all affects
the Construction. It marks a
moderate depression of the voice,
with a pause greater than a Comma.</p>

<p>1. In the fifteenth year of the reign
of Tiberius Cæsar, Pontius Pilate
late being Governour of Judea, the
word of God came unto John the
Son of Zecharias in the wilderness.</p>

<p>2. And he came into all the
country about Jordan preaching the
baptism of repentance for the remission
of sins.</p>

<p>3. And the same John had his
raiment of camel’s hair, and a leathern
girdle about his loins, and
his meat was locusts and wild honey.</p>

<p>4. Then said he to the multitude
that came forth to be baptized
of him, O generation of vipers, who
hath warned you to flee from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
wrath to come? Bring forth therefore
fruits meet for repentance.</p>

<p>5. And as all men mused in their
hearts of John, whether he were
the Christ, or not; John answered,
saying unto them all, I indeed
baptize you with water; but one
mightier than I cometh, the latchet
of whose shoes I am not worthy
to unloose: he shall baptize you
with the Holy Ghost and with fire.</p>

<p>6. Now when all the people were
baptized, it came to pass, that, Jesus
also being baptized and praying,
the heaven was opened, and
the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily
shape upon him; and lo! a
voice from heaven saying, This is
my beloved Son, in whom I am
well pleased.</p>

<p>“When He the Spirit of Truth is come,
he will guide you into <i>all Truth</i>.” <i>John</i> xvi. 13.
That is, according to this Translation, into
all Truth whatsoever, into Truth of all kinds:
very different from the meaning of the Evangelist,
and from the Original, εις πασαν την
αληθειαν, into <i>all the Truth</i>; that is, into all
Evangelical Truth.</p>

<p>“Truly this was <i>the</i> Son of God.” <i>Matt.</i>
xxvii. 54. and <i>Mark</i> xv. 39. This Translation
supposes, that the Roman Centurion had
a proper and adequate notion of the character
of Jesus, as the Son of God in a peculiar and
incommunicable sense: whereas, it is probable,
both from the circumstances of the
History, and from the expression of the Original,
(ὑιος Θεου, a Son of God, not ὁ υιος, <i>the</i>
Son) that he only meant to acknowledge him
to be an extraordinary person, and more than
a mere man; according to his own notion of
Sons of Gods in the Pagan Theology. This
is also more agreeable to St. Luke’s account of
the same confession of the Centurion: “Certainly
this was δικαιος, a righteous man;” not
ὁ Δικαιος, the Just One. The same may be
observed of Nebuchadnezzar’s words, <i>Dan.</i>
iii. 25.—“And the form of the fourth is like
<i>the</i> Son of God:” it ought to be by the Indefinite
Article, like <i>a</i> Son of God: ὁμοια ὑιῳ
Θεου, as Theodotion very properly renders it:

<p>These Remarks may serve to shew the great
importance of the proper use of the Article;
the near affinity there is between the Greek
Article, and the English Definite Article;
and the excellence of the English Language
in this respect, which by means of its two Articles
does most precisely determine the extent
of signification of Common Names: whereas
the Greek has only one Article, and it has
puzzled all the Grammarians to reduce the
use of that to any clear and certain rules.</p>

either of the Printers, or of the Compilers.⸺“My
paper is the <i>Ulysses his</i>
bow, in which every man of wit or learning
may try his strength.” Addison, Guardian Nᵒ
98. This is no slip of Mr. Addison’s pen: he
gives us his opinion upon this point very explicitly
in another place. “The same single
letter [<i>s</i>] on many occasions does the office of
a whole word, and represents the <i>his</i> and <i>her</i>
of our forefathers.” Addison, Spect. Nᵒ 135.
The latter instance might have shewn him,
how groundless this notion is: for it is not
easy to conceive, how the letter <i>s</i> added to a
Feminine Noun should represent the word <i>her</i>;
any more than it should the word <i>their</i>, added
to a Plural Noun: as, “the <i>children’s</i> bread.”
But the direct derivation of this Case from the
Saxon Genitive Case is sufficient of itself to
decide this matter.</p>

observed, that in the Subjunctive Mode, the
event being spoken of under a condition, or
supposition, or in the form of a wish, and
therefore as doubtful and contingent, the
Verb itself in the Present, and the Auxiliary
both of the Present and Past Imperfect
Times, often carry with them somewhat of a
Future sense: as, “If he come to-morrow, I
may speak to him:” ⸺ “If he should,
or would, come to-morrow, I might, would,
could, or should, speak to him.” Observe
also, that the Auxiliary <i>should</i> in the Imperfect
Times is used to express the Present, as well
as the Past; as, “It <i>is</i> my desire, that he <i>should</i>
[now] come;” as well as, “It <i>was</i> my desire
that he <i>should</i> [then] come.” So that in this
Mode the precise Time of the Verb is very
much determined by the nature and drift of
the Sentence.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_25" href="#FNanchor_25" class="label">[25]</a> Bishop Wilkins gives the following elegant
investigation of the Modes in his <i>Real
Character</i>, Part iii. Chap. 5.</p>

<p>“To shew in what manner the Subject is to
be joined with his Predicate, the Copula between
them is affected with a Particle, which
from the use of it is called <i>Modus</i>, the manner
or <i>Mode</i>.</p>

<p>Now the Subject and Predicate may be
joined together either <i>Simply</i>, or with some
kind of <i>Limitation</i>; and accordingly these
Modes are Primary or Secondary.</p>

<p>The Primary Modes are called by Grammarians
Indicative and Imperative.</p>

<p>When the matter is declared to be so, or at
least when it seems in the Speaker’s power to
have it be so, as the bare union of Subject
and Predicate would import, then the Copula
is nakedly expressed without any variation:
and this manner of expressing it is called the
Indicative Mode.</p>

<p>When it is neither declared to be so, nor
seems immediately in the Speaker’s power to
have it so; then he can do no more in words
but make out the expression of his will to him
that hath the thing in his power; namely to</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td rowspan="3" class="valign">his</td>
    <td>{</td>
    <td>Superior</td>
    <td>}</td>
    <td rowspan="3" class="valign">by</td>
    <td>{</td>
    <td>Petition,</td>
    <td>}</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>{</td>
    <td>Equal</td>
    <td>}</td>
    <td>{</td>
    <td>Persuasion,</td>
    <td>}</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>{</td>
    <td>Inferior</td>
    <td>}</td>
    <td>{</td>
    <td>Command.</td>
    <td>}</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>And the manner of these affecting the Copula, (Be it
so, or, let it be so,) is called the Imperative
Mode; of which there are these three varieties
very fit to be distinctly provided for. As
for that other use of the Imperative Mode,
when it signifies <i>Permission</i>; this may be sufficiently
expressed by the <i>Secondary Mode</i> of
<i>Liberty</i>; You <i>may</i> do it.</p>

<p>The Secondary Modes are such, as, when
the Copula is affected with any of them, make
the Sentence to be (as the Logicians call it) a
<i>Modal Proposition</i>.</p>

<p>This happens, when the matter in discourse,
namely, the being, or doing, or suffering of a
thing, is considered, not <i>simply by itself</i>, but
<i>gradually in its causes</i>, from which it proceeds
<i>contingently</i>, or <i>necessarily</i>.</p>

<p>Then a thing seems to be left <i>Contingent</i>,
when the Speaker expresses only the <i>Possibility</i>
of it, or his own <i>Liberty</i> to it.</p>

<p>1. The <i>Possibility</i> of a thing depends upon
the power of its cause; and may be expressed</p>

“in the Preterit and Participle Preterit

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_33" href="#FNanchor_33" class="label">[33]</a> Frequent mistakes are made in the formation
of the Participle of this Verb. The
analogy plainly requires <i>sitten</i>; which was formerly
in use: “The army having <i>sitten</i> there
so long:”⸺“Which was enough to make
him stir, that would not have <i>sitten</i> still, though
Hanibal had been quiet.” Raleigh. “That
no Parliament should be dissolved, till it had
<i>sitten</i> five months.” Hobbes, Hist. of Civil
Wars, p. 257. But it is now almost wholly
disused, the form of the Past Time <i>sat</i>, having
taken its place. Dr. Middleton hath with
great propriety restored the true Participle:⸺“To
have <i>sitten</i> on the heads of the
Apostles:”⸺“to have <i>sitten</i> upon each
of them.” Works, Vol. II. p. 30. “Blessed
is the man,⸺that hath not <i>sat</i> in the seat
of the scornful.” Ps. i. 1. The old Editions
have <i>sit</i>; which may be perhaps allowed as a
Contraction of <i>sitten</i>. “And when he was
<i>set</i>, his disciples came unto him:” καθισαντος
αυτου. Matt. v. 1.⸺“who is <i>set</i> on the
right hand;”⸺“and is <i>set</i> down at the
right hand of the throne of God:” in both
places εκαθισεν. Heb. viii. 1. &amp; xii. 2. <i>Set</i>
can be no part of the Verb <i>to sit</i>. If it belongs
to the Verb <i>to set</i>, the Translation in these
passages is wrong: for <i>to set</i> signifies <i>to place</i>,
but without any designation of the posture
of the person placed; which is a circumstance
of importance expressed by the original.</p>

Bentley has endeavoured to impose upon Milton
in several places: see P. L. vii. 15. ix.
829, 883, 1147. x. 267, 1001. On the other
hand, where Milton has been really guilty of
this fault, he, very inconsistently with himself,
corrects him, and sets him right. His
Latin Grammar Rules were happily out of
his head, and by a kind of <i>vernacular instinct</i>
(so, I imagine, he would call it) he perceived
that his Author was wrong.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_52" href="#FNanchor_52" class="label">[52]</a> This Rule arises from the nature and
idiom of our Language, and from as plain a
principle as any on which it is founded:
namely, that a word which has the Article
before it, and a Noun, with the Possessive
Preposition <i>of</i>, after it, must be a Noun; and
if a Noun, it ought to follow the Construction
of a Noun, and not have the Regimen of a
Verb. It is the Participial Termination of
this sort of words that is apt to deceive us,
and make us treat them as if they were of an
amphibious species, partly Nouns, and partly
Verbs. I believe there are hardly any of
our Writers, who have not fallen into this
inaccuracy. That it is such, will perhaps more
clearly appear, if we examine and resolve one
or two examples in this kind.</p>

<p>“God, who didst teach the hearts of thy
faithful people, by <i>the sending</i> to them <i>the
light</i> of thy Holy Spirit:⸺” Collect,
Whitsunday. <i>Sending</i> is in this place a Noun;
for it is accompanied with the Article: nevertheless
it is also a Transitive Verb, for it governs
the Noun <i>light</i> in the Objective Case:
but this is inconsistent; let it be either the
one or the other, and abide by its proper
Construction. That these Participial Words
are sometimes real Nouns is undeniable; for
they have a Plural Number as such: as, “the
<i>outgoings</i> of the morning.” <i>The Sending</i> is
the same with <i>the Mission</i>; which necessarily
requires the Preposition <i>of</i> after it, to mark
the relation between it and <i>the light</i>; <i>the
mission of the light</i>; and so, <i>the sending of the
light</i>. The Phrase would be proper either
way, by keeping to the Construction of the
Noun, <i>by the sending of the light</i>; or of the
Participle, or Gerund, <i>by sending the light</i>.</p>

<p>Again:⸺“Sent to prepare the way
of thy Son our Saviour, <i>by preaching of Repentance</i>:⸺”
Collect, St. John Baptist.
Here the Participle, or Gerund, hath as improperly
the Preposition <i>of</i> after it; and so is
deprived of its Verbal Regimen, by which as
a Transitive it would govern the Noun <i>Repentance</i>
in the Objective Case. Besides, the
Phrase is rendered obscure and ambiguous:
for the obvious meaning of it in its present
form is, “by preaching concerning or on the
Subject of Repentance;” whereas the sense
intended is, “by publishing the Covenant of
Repentance, and declaring Repentance to be
a condition of acceptance with God.” The
Phrase would have been perfectly right and
determinate to this sense either way; by the
Noun, <i>by the preaching of repentance</i>; or by the
Participle, <i>by preaching repentance</i>.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_53" href="#FNanchor_53" class="label">[53]</a> These are the three Primary Modes, or
manners of expressing our thoughts concerning
the being, doing, or suffering of a thing.
If it comes within our knowledge, we explain
it, or make a declaration of it; if we
are ignorant or doubtful of it, we make an
inquiry about it; if it is not immediately in
our power, we express our desire or will concerning
it. In Theory therefore the Interrogative
form seems to have as good a Title to
a Mode of its own, as either of the other two;
but Practice has determined it otherwise; and
has in all the Languages, with which we are
most acquainted, supplied the place of an Interrogative
Mode, either by Particles of Interrogation,
or by a peculiar order of the
words in the sentence. If it be true, as I
have somewhere read, that the Modes of the
Verbs are more numerous in the Lapland
Tongue than in any other, possibly the Laplanders
may be provided with an Interrogative
Mode.</p>

expressed in the Past Indefinite Time; it is

“they <i>were drown’d</i>.” We observed,
that the last mentioned event is subsequent to

the latter part of the sentence depends intirely
on the <i>Supposition</i> expressed in the former, “of

xxiii. 24. διυλιζοντες, “which strain <i>out</i>, or
take a gnat <i>out</i> of the liquor by straining it:”
the impropriety of the Preposition has wholly
destroyed the meaning of the Phrase. Observe
also, that the Noun generally requires
after it the same Preposition as the Verb from
which it is formed: “It was perfectly in
compliance <i>to</i> [with] some persons, for whose
opinion I have great deference.” Swift, Pref.
to Temple’s Memoirs. “Not from any personal
hatred to them, but in justification <i>to</i> [of]
the best of Queens.” Swift, Examiner, Nᵒ 23.
In the last example, the Verb being Transitive
and requiring the Objective Case, the
Noun formed from it seems to require the
Possessive Case, or its Preposition, after it. Or
perhaps he meant to say, “in <i>justice</i> to the
best of Queens.” “No discouragement for
the authors to proceed.” Tale of a Tub, Preface.
“A strict observance <i>after</i> times and
fashions.” Ibid. Sect. ii. So the Noun <i>Aversion</i>,
(that is, a turning away,) requires the
Preposition <i>from</i> after it; and does not properly
admit of <i>to</i>, <i>for</i>, or <i>towards</i>, which are
often used with it.</p>

day!” Ezek. xxx. 2. that is, Wo be <i>to</i> the
day. The word <i>worth</i> is not the Adjective,
but the Saxon Verb <i>weorthan</i>, or <i>worthan</i>,
<i>fieri</i>, <i>to be</i>, <i>to become</i>; which is often used by
Chaucer, and is still retained as an Auxiliary
Verb in the German Language.</p>

<p>That is, “all <i>whom</i> he lov’d, or <i>who</i> lov’d
him:” or to make it more easy by supplying
a Relative that has no variation of Cases, “all
<i>that</i> he lov’d, or <i>that</i> lov’d him.” The Construction
is hazardous, and hardly justifiable,
even in Poetry. “In the temper of mind he
was then.” Addison, Spect. Nᵒ 549. “In
the posture I lay.” Swift, Gulliver, Part 1.
Chap. 1. In these and the like Phrases, which
are very common, there is an Ellipsis both of
the Relative and the Preposition; which were
much better supplied: “In the temper of
mind <i>in which</i> he was then:” “In the posture
<i>in which</i> I lay.” In general, the omission of
the Relative seems to be too much indulged
in the familiar style; it is ungraceful in the
serious; and of whatever kind the style be, it
is apt to be attended with obscurity and ambiguity.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_73" href="#FNanchor_73" class="label">[73]</a> The Connective parts of Sentences are of
all others the most important, and require the
most care and attention: for it is by these
chiefly that the train of thought, the course
of reasoning, and the whole progress of the
mind in continued discourse of all kinds, is
laid open; and on the right use of these the
perspicuity, that is, the first and greatest
beauty, of style principally depends. Relatives
and Conjunctions are the instruments of
Connection in discourse: it may be of use to
point out some of the most common inaccuracies,
that writers are apt to fall into with
respect to them; and a few examples of faults
may perhaps be more instructive, than any
rules of propriety that can be given. Here
therefore shall be added some further examples
of inaccuracies in the use of Relatives.</p>

<p>The Relative placed before the Antecedent:
Example; “The bodies, which we daily
handle, make us perceive, that whilst they
remain between <i>them</i>, they do by an insurmountable
force hinder the approach of our <i>hands</i> that
press them.” Locke, Essay, B. 2. C. 4. §. 1.
Here the sense is suspended, and the sentence
is unintelligible, till you get to the end of it:
there is no Antecedent, to which the Relative
<i>them</i> can be referred, but <i>bodies</i>; but, “whilst
the bodies remain between the bodies,” makes
no sense at all. When you get to <i>hands</i>, the
difficulty is cleared up, the sense helping out
the Construction: yet there still remains an
ambiguity in the Relatives <i>they</i>, <i>them</i>, which
in number and gender are equally applicable
to <i>bodies</i> or <i>hands</i>; this, tho’ it may not here
be the occasion of much obscurity, which is
commonly the effect of it, yet is always disagreeable
and inelegant: as in the following
examples.</p>

<p>“Men look with an evil eye upon the good
that is in others; and think, that <i>their</i> reputation
obscures <i>them</i>; and that <i>their</i> commendable
qualities do stand in <i>their</i> light: and
therefore <i>they</i> do what <i>they</i> can to cast a cloud
over <i>them</i>, that the bright shining of <i>their</i> virtues
may not obscure <i>them</i>.” Tillotson, Vol. I.
Serm. 42.</p>

<p>“The Earl of Falmouth and Mr. Coventry
were rivals <i>who</i> should have most influence
with the Duke, <i>who</i> loved the Earl best, but
thought the other the wiser man, <i>who</i> supported
Pen, <i>who</i> disobliged all the Courtiers,
even against the Earl, <i>who</i> contemned Pen
as a fellow of no sense.” Clarendon, Cont. p.
264.</p>

<p>But the following Sentence cannot possibly
be understood without a careful recollection
of circumstances through some pages preceding.</p>

<p>“All which, with the King’s and Queen’s
so ample promises to <i>him</i> [the Treasurer] so
few hours before the conferring the place on
another, and the Duke of York’s manner of
receiving <i>him</i> [the Treasurer,] after <i>he</i> [the
Chancellor] had been shut up with <i>him</i> [the
Duke,] as <i>he</i> [the Treasurer] was informed,
might very well excuse <i>him</i> [the Treasurer]
for thinking <i>he</i> [the Chancellor] had some
share in the affront <i>he</i> [the Treasurer] had undergone.”
Clarendon, Cont. p. 296.</p>

<p>“Breaking a Constitution by the very same
errors, <i>that</i> so many have been <i>broke</i> before.”
Swift, Contests and Dissensions, &amp;c. Chap. 5.
Here the Relative is employed not only to
represent the Antecedent Noun <i>the errors</i>, but
likewise the Preposition <i>by</i> prefixed to it. It
ought to be, “the same errors, <i>by which</i> so
many have been <i>broken</i> before.”</p>

<p>Again: “⸺An Undertaking; <i>which</i>,
although it has failed, (partly &amp;c, and partly
&amp;c,) is no objection at all to an Enterprize so
well concerted, and with such fair probability
of success.” Swift, Conduct of the Allies.
That is, “Which Undertaking is no objection
to an Enterprize so well concerted;” that is,
“to itself:” he means, “<i>the failing of which</i>
is no objection at all to it.”</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_78" href="#FNanchor_78" class="label">[78]</a> I have been the more particular in noting
the proper uses of these Conjunctions, because
they occur very frequently, and, as it was
observed before of Connective words in general,
are of great importance with respect to
the clearness and beauty of style. I may add
too, because mistakes in the use of them are
very common; as it will appear by the following
Examples.</p>

<p>⸺ “That all the application he could
make, <i>nor</i> the King’s own interposition, could
prevail with Her Majesty.” Clarendon, Hist.
Vol. III. p. 179. Sometimes to be supplied
by a subsequent Negative: “His rule holdeth
still, that nature, <i>nor</i> the engagement of
words, are <i>not</i> so forcible as custom.” Bacon,
Essay xxxix. “The King <i>nor</i> the Queen were
<i>not</i> at all deceived.” Clarendon, Hist. Vol. II.
p. 363. These forms of expression seem both
of them equally improper.</p>

<p><i>So</i> ⸺, <i>as</i>, was used by the Writers of the
last Century, to express a Consequence, instead
of <i>So</i> ⸺, <i>that</i>: Examples; “The relations
are <i>so</i> uncertain, <i>as</i> [that] they require
a great deal of examination.” Bacon, Nat.
Hist. “<i>So as</i> [that] it is a hard calumny to
affirm, ⸺.” Temple. “This computation
being <i>so</i> easy and trivial, <i>as</i> [that] it is
a shame to mention it.” Swift, Conduct of
the Allies. “That the Spaniards were <i>so</i>
violently affected to the House of Austria, <i>as</i>
[that] the whole kingdom would revolt.”
Ibid. Swift, I believe, is the last of our
good Writers, who has frequently used this
manner of expression: it seems improper, and
is deservedly grown obsolete.</p>

<p><i>As</i> instead of <i>that</i>, in another manner:
“If a man have that penetration of judgement,
<i>as</i> [that] he can discern what things
are to be laid open.” Bacon, Essay vi. “It
is the nature of extreme self-lovers, <i>as</i> [that]
they will set an house on fire, <i>and</i> it were but
to roast their eggs.” Id. Essay xxiii. “They
would have given him such satisfaction in
other particulars, <i>as</i> [that] a full and happy
peace must have ensued.” Clarendon, Vol.
III. p. 214. “We should sufficiently weigh
the objects of our hope; whether they be
such, <i>as</i> [that] we may reasonably expect
from them what they propose in their fruition;
and whether they are such, as we are pretty
sure of attaining.” Addison, Spect. Nᵒ 535.
“France was then disposed to conclude a
peace upon such conditions, <i>as</i> [that] it was
not worth the life of a granadier to refuse
them.” Swift, Four last years of the Queen,
B. ii.</p>

<p><i>As</i> instead of the Relative <i>that</i>, or <i>which</i>:
“The Duke had not behaved with that loyalty,
<i>as</i> [which] he ought to have done.” Clarendon,
Hist. Vol. II. p. 460. “⸺ With
those thoughts <i>as</i> [which] might contribute
to their honour.” Ibid. p. 565. “In
the order, <i>as</i> they lie in his Preface.” Middleton,
Works Vol. III p. 8. It ought to be,
either, “<i>in order</i>, as they lie;” or, “in the
order, <i>in which</i> they lie.” “Securing to yourselves
a succession of able and worthy men, <i>as</i>
[which] may adorn this place.” Atterbury,
Sermons, Vol. IV. 12.</p>

<p>The Relative <i>that</i> instead of <i>as</i>: “Such
sharp replies, <i>that</i> [as] cost him his life in few
months after.” Clarendon, Hist. Vol. III. p.
179.</p>

<p>The Relative <i>who</i> ⸺, instead of <i>as</i>:
“There was no man <i>so</i> sanguine, <i>who did not
apprehend</i> some ill consequence from the late
change.” Swift, Examiner Nᵒ 24. It ought
to be, either, “<i>so</i> sanguine, <i>as not to apprehend</i>,
⸺” or, “There was no man, <i>how</i> sanguine
<i>soever</i>, <i>who</i> did not apprehend.”</p>

<p><i>As</i> improperly omitted: “They are <i>so</i>
bold [as] to pronounce ⸺.” Swift, Tale
of a Tub, Sect. vii.</p>

<p><i>Too</i> ⸺, <i>that</i>, improperly used as Correspondent
Conjunctions: “Whose Characters
are <i>too</i> profligate, <i>that</i> the managing of them
should be of any consequence.” Swift, Examiner
Nᵒ 24. And, <i>too</i> ⸺, <i>than</i>: “You
that are a step higher than a Philosopher, a
Divine; yet have <i>too</i> much grace and wit
<i>than</i> to be a Bishop.” Pope to Swift, Letter
80. <i>So</i> ⸺, <i>but</i>: “If the appointing and
apportioning of penalties to crimes be not <i>so</i>
properly a consideration of justice, <i>but rather</i>
[as] of prudence in the Lawgiver.” Tillotson,
Vol. I. Serm. 35. And to conclude with
an example, in which, whatever may be
thought of the accuracy of the expression, the
justness of the observation will be acknowledged;
which may serve also as an apology for
this and many of the preceding Notes: “No
errors are <i>so</i> trivial, <i>but</i> they deserve to be
mended.” Pope to Steele, Letter 6.</p>
